<h2 class="uline"><br />PREFACE</h2>


<p><b>Samson and his Arch-Eulogist.</b>&mdash;Abbot Samson of St.
Edmundsbury and his biographer, Jocelin of Brakelond, undoubtedly owe
such immortality as they possess to their introduction to the world at
large by Thomas Carlyle. Learned historians and commentators of the
past had made use of the dry facts of the Chronicle for their
disquisitions and treatises; but none had recognized the human
interest of Jocelin's narrative until the Sage of Chelsea seized upon
it as evidence of that theory of Hero Worship on which he loved to
insist.</p>

<p>The whole of the seventeen chapters of Book II. of "Past and
Present," published in 1843, are devoted to a study of Abbot Samson,
and the lessons which Carlyle thought "our own poor century" could
learn from him.</p>

<p>From that day to this, Samson has been more or less a household
word; and, as John Richard Green says in his "Stray Studies" (1876),
"In the wandering <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xvi"
id="page_xvi">{xvi}</a></span> gossipy pages of Jocelin of Brakelond the
life of the twelfth century, so far as it could penetrate abbey walls,
still glows distinct for us round the figure of the shrewd, practical,
kindly, imperious abbot who looks out, a little travestied perhaps,
from the pages of Mr. Carlyle."</p>

<p><b>The Chronicle.</b>&mdash;Mr. Green further says:&mdash;"By a rare accident
the figure of the silent, industrious Norfolk monk, who at the close
of Henry the Second's reign suddenly found himself ruler of the
wealthiest, if not the greatest, of English abbeys, starts out
distinct from the dim canvas of the annals of his house. Annals indeed
in any strict sense St. Edmund's has none; no national chronicle was
ever penned in its scriptorium such as that which flings lustre round
its rival, St. Albans; nor is even a record of its purely monastic
life preserved such as that which gives a local and ecclesiastical
interest to its rival of Glastonbury. One book alone the abbey has
given us, but that one book is worth a thousand chronicles."</p>

<p>The original manuscript of the Chronicle occupies 43 folios
(121-163) of a thick quarto volume on vellum once in the library of
Bury Abbey, afterwards in the hands of the family of Bacon of
Redgrave, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xvii"
id="page_xvii">{xvii}</a></span> then belonging to Bishop Stillingfleet of
Worcester, and now preserved in the British Museum amongst the
Harleian Manuscripts. The contents of this <i>Liber Albus</i> (Harl.
MS. 1005) are very varied; and a complete list of the 144 items in it
which relate to the Abbey will be found on pp. 122-4 of the 1821
Edition of the <i>Monasticon</i>. (Another copy of the Chronicle was
in the Cottonian MS. Vitellius <span class="smcap">dxv.</span>, burnt
in the fire of 1731.) Three facsimiles of portions of the MS. are
given in the Camden Society's Edition of the Latin text (to be
presently referred to), and the writing is there ascribed to the end
of the 13th or beginning of the 14th century.</p>

<p><b>Previous Editions of the Chronicle.</b>&mdash;In the year 1840, John
Gage Rokewode, F.R.S. (1786-1842), Director of the Society of
Antiquaries, brought out for the Camden Society a thin quarto book in
the familiar green cover, which he entitled "Chronica Jocelini de
Brakelonda de rebus gestis Samsonis Abbatis Monasterii Sancti
Edmundi." It was this book that attracted the attention of Carlyle,
with the results already stated. Rokewode was a scion of the
distinguished family of Gage of Hengrave, near Bury, and took the
additional name of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xviii"
id="page_xviii">{xviii}</a></span> Rokewode on inheriting in 1838 the
estates of the Rookwood family. He was a very learned genealogist, and
the author of a History of Hengrave and of the Hundred of Thingoe. His
observations on Suffolk families and topography are therefore to be
relied upon, though subsequent investigation has corrected some of his
notes on historical matters.</p>

<p>Rokewode's text was in the original Latin; but to meet the popular
demand for the Chronicle caused by Carlyle's published appreciation of
it in "Past and Present" (1843), a translation into English was made
by Thomas Edlyne Tomlins (1804-1872), and was published in 1844 by
Whitaker &amp; Co. in the "Popular Library of Modern Authors," under
the title of "Monastic and Social Life in the Twelfth Century."</p>

<p>Mr. T. E. Tomlins was a nephew of the better known Sir Thomas
Edlyne Tomlins (1762-1841), assistant counsel to the Treasury, who
wrote "The Law of Wills" and other well-known text-books. The younger
Thomas was an attorney, and also wrote on legal subjects. Tomlins'
translation of Jocelin was issued in the somewhat forbidding form of a
tall paper-covered book of 64 pages of double columns of small type,
without any break from start to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xix"
id="page_xix">{xix}</a></span> finish: the few notes at the end being
mostly on legal points, and none of them of great merit.</p>

<p>It does not appear that Mr. Tomlins had any special knowledge of
his subject; and, as a consequence, his translation contained a
quantity of errors, both of omission and commission. His book has been
used as the ground-work for the present edition, but the alterations
made in the text have been so numerous and important as to be
practically equivalent to a new translation altogether. The three
Appendices (pages 215-278) are wholly new.</p>

<p>The task of rendering the Latin text into satisfactory and accurate
English has been made easier by the publication in 1890-6 of Mr.
Thomas Arnold's three volumes of "Memorials of St. Edmund's Abbey"
(No. 96 of the Rolls Series). "Tom" Arnold (1823-1900) was the second
son of Arnold of Rugby and the younger brother of Matthew Arnold; and
he undertook a quantity of work for the Rolls Series, not all of which
he was able to carry through with the completeness that he desired.
Especially with regard to the Annals of St. Edmundsbury there was a
quantity of material that he could not deal with in the leisure at his
command. But so far as concerns the Chronicle of Jocelin (which <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_xx" id="page_xx">{xx}</a></span> occupies 228
pages of his Volume I.), his edition of the original Latin text was
carefully revised and annotated.</p>

<p><b>The Chronicler.</b>&mdash;Of Jocelin of Brakelond very little is
certainly known beyond what he himself tells us in the Chronicle.
There are two streets in Bury St. Edmunds known as the Long and Short
Brackland or Braklond, and probably Jocelin took his name from his
place of birth. In the text of the Chronicle, however, and in other
13th century documents in which his name is recorded, he appears
simply as Jocelin. He tells us he took the habit in 1173, "the year
when the Flemings were taken captive without the town" (page 1); and
that he then came under the care of Samson, at that time master of the
novices, who told him some of his own experiences by way of warning
against interference with the constituted authorities (6).</p>

<p>At the time of Samson's election as Abbot, in 1182, Jocelin was
prior's chaplain, but within four months he was made abbot's chaplain,
"noting many things and committing them to memory" (39): for which all
students of English history are eternally grateful to him. In his
capacity as Samson's chaplain, Jocelin was "constantly with him by day
and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxi" id="page_xxi">{xxi}</a></span>
night for six years, and had the opportunity of becoming fully
conversant with the worthiness of his life and the wisdom of his rule"
(56).</p>

<p>Jocelin evidently starts at first with an admiration for Samson's
vigorous and independent régime (see especially pages 52-3); but later
on his faith in his master seems to have been a little shaken, and
Samson's action in practically "jockeying" his favourite Herbert into
the office of prior takes Jocelin's breath away. The eventful meeting
of the chapter over, he sits down stupefied in the porch of the guest
chamber (he being then hospitarius), and reflects on the situation
(198). He cannot approve, moreover, Samson's action with regard to
John Ruffus and Adam the Infirmarer, where he more than hints at the
Abbot's acceptance of a bribe (200). The banking up by Samson of the
fishpond at Babwell, thus flooding the pastures and gardens of others,
he describes as "another stain of evil doing" (201): the Abbot's
passionate retort that "his fish pond was not to be spoilt on account
of our meadows," obviously offending Jocelin's sense of the
proprieties. He demurs, moreover, to the willingness of certain of the
monks to strip even the shrine of St. Edmund himself to obtain an
exemption of the Abbey from episcopal visitation, pointing out <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxii" id="page_xxii">{xxii}</a></span> that
there might come a time when the convent might need the control of a
bishop, archbishop, or legate, over a tyrannous or spendthrift abbot
(7).</p>

<p>It is perhaps for these reasons that we find Jocelin, at a date
after Samson's death, on the side of the party of caution and
moderation in the disputes over the election of a new abbot. The
author, whoever he was, of the interpolated narrative in the Chronicle
relating to Henry of Essex (101 <i>et seq.</i>) refers to "Master
Jocelin our almoner, a man of exalted piety, powerful in word and in
deed"; and there can hardly be any doubt that this was our Jocelin. In
the highly complicated story (printed in Mr. Arnold's second volume)
of the preliminaries to the final approval by King John of Samson's
successor, Abbot Hugh II., Jocelin the almoner took the side of Robert
of Gravelee, the sacrist, who advocated the adoption of the plan
followed when the previous vacancy occurred, of submitting to the king
names from whom he could make a selection (as indeed John had asked
might be done by letter dated 25 July, 1213), instead of asking him,
as they did, to confirm an election already made. Jocelin, in a speech
delivered in the chapter-house, seems indeed to have been the first to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxiii" id="page_xxiii">{xxiii}</a></span>
start the view that the convent had made a mistake, and that it ought
to put itself right with the king. He again insisted on this at a
second debate in December, 1213, and took a prominent part in the
subsequent discussions, his name being recorded in the division list
of June, 1214, when 30 voted on his side, and 32 for adherence to the
claims of the Abbey.</p>

<p>The three delegates, the Abbot of Wardon, the Prior of Dunstable,
and the Dean of Salisbury, who had been appointed by the Pope on May
18, 1214, to inquire into the Bury election, held the last but one of
their numerous sittings on February 12, 1215, at which Jocelin was
present. At last the delegates announced on March 10 their judgment
confirming the election, which, with considerable trouble, they
persuaded the sacrist and his party to accept, and to exchange with
the new abbot the kiss of peace.</p>

<p>When, on April 24, 1215, the abbot elect, unsuccessful in obtaining
John's favour, and refusing to bribe the king, though advised to do so
by the courtiers, appointed certain officials to the custody of Abbey
manors, he took the advice, amongst other high officers, of Jocelin
the almoner; and this is the last we hear of our Chronicler.</p>

<p>Jocelin himself mentions (23) that he had written a <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxiv" id="page_xxiv">{xxiv}</a></span> book on
the many signs and wonders in connection with the martyrdom by the
Jews of the boy Robert, who was buried in the Abbey Church; but this
work is not known to be extant. The inaccurate Bale also ascribes to
him the authorship of the tract <i>Super Electione Hugonis</i> (also
in the Liber Albus), from which the above facts as to Jocelin's later
life have been gleaned. But there is no authority for this; and, as
Mr. Arnold points out (i. lix.), the style of that work is different
from the Chronicle.</p>

<p>Whatever criticisms one might be tempted to pass on Carlyle's
appreciation of Samson, there need be no dissentient voice to his
summing up of Jocelin's character:&mdash;</p>

<p class="lgeblkquot"> An ingenious and ingenuous, a cheery-hearted,
innocent, yet withal shrewd, noticing, quick-witted man; and from
under his monk's cowl has looked out on the narrow section of the
world in a really human manner.... The man is of patient, peaceable,
loving, clear-smiling nature; open for this or that.... Also he has a
pleasant wit, and loves a timely joke, though in mild, subdued manner.
A learned, grown man, yet with the heart as of a good child.</p>

<p><b>The Central Figure of the Chronicle.</b>&mdash;Whatever his other
merits, Jocelin's strong point was certainly not chronological
sequence. With the assistance of the Table of Dates printed on pages
261-267, the reader will, it is hoped, get some useful <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxv" id="page_xxv">{xxv}</a></span> sort of
idea of the busy life of Abbot Samson, both within and without the
walls of the monastery, whilst it was under his vigorous rule; and as
to his personal characteristics, virtues and foibles, they are writ
large in almost every chapter of the Chronicle.</p>

<p>He was obviously of humble origin, and his dialect was that of his
native county of Norfolk (62). He seems to have lost his father early,
for we read of his conferring, soon after he became Abbot, a benefice
upon the son of a man of lowly station who had been kind to him in his
youth and looked after his interests (66). As a child of nine, he had
been taken by his mother to a pilgrimage to St. Edmund, after a dream
which presaged his future service under that saint (56). When he was a
poor clerk, William, the schoolmaster of Diss, had given him free
admission to his school: a favour which he requited by giving Walter,
son of William, the living of Chevington (67). Similarly, he helped
those of his kinsmen who had recognized him when he was a poor clerk,
provided they were worthy; but with those who had then held aloof from
him he wished to have no dealings (66).</p>

<p>At some early date Samson went to Paris to study, a friend who then
supported him there by the proceeds of the sale of holy water
receiving afterwards a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxvi"
id="page_xxvi">{xxvi}</a></span> benefice from him (66). Just as he did
not forget the friends who had helped him in his early struggles so he
remembered past kindnesses shown to him when he was a poor monk and
out of favour with the authorities. When Hugh, his predecessor,
clapped him into irons, Hugh's cupbearer Elias brought him some wine
to quench his prison thirst (67); and when he needed a night's lodging
on his return from Durham on the business of the Abbey, a resident at
Risby gave him the shelter which a neighbour refused (68). Neither
favour was forgotten when Elias and William of Risby came before him
as landlord.</p>

<p>By 1160 Samson was back from abroad as master of the schools at
Bury, though he did not become a professed monk till 1166. Meanwhile
he had been sent on an errand to Rome, with reference to the church at
Woolpit, in which his native wit showed itself (73, 74). He seems to
have been successful in his mission, getting from Pope Alexander III.
a reversion for the monastery of the Woolpit living; but, perhaps
because he returned too late to prevent Geoffrey Ridel being appointed
by the king (74), Abbot Hugh banished him, on his return, to Castle
Acre. Here he remained in exile a long time (74), and he was sent
there again after he had <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxvii"
id="page_xxvii">{xxvii}</a></span> become a cloister monk, and had spoken
up "for the good of our Church" in opposition to the Abbot (6).</p>

<p><b>Samson in Subordinate Offices.</b>&mdash;Much as Hugh disliked
Samson, he seems to have been a little afraid of him; and, to
reconcile matters, he made Samson subsacrist. "Often accused," says
Jocelin, "he was transferred from one office to another, being
successively guest master, pittance master, third prior, and again
subsacrist" (9). But he could not be induced to fawn on and flatter
the Abbot, as other officials did; and Hugh declared that "he had
never seen a man whom he could not bend to his will, except Samson the
subsacrist" (10).</p>

<p>When at length Hugh's trying dispensation came to an end, through
his horse accident at Canterbury in 1180, Samson was, as subsacrist,
busy with new building operations for the Church (14). His superior
officer, the bibulous William Wiardel, the sacrist, was jealous of
him, and persuaded the wardens of the Abbey to stop any further
expense for works during the vacancy (15). But Samson knew some things
to William's financial and moral discredit, on which he was later able
to base the sacrist's dismissal from office (46-7).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxviii"
id="page_xxviii">{xxviii}</a></span> The gossip amongst the monks as to
which of the brethren should fill Hugh's place is admirably told by
Jocelin (Chap. ii.). Whilst the rest were babbling at blood-letting
season, Samson the subsacrist sat smiling but saying nothing (21). The
receipt of Henry II.'s order or permission to make choice of a new
Abbot put the monastery in a flutter; and the selection of the
deputation to wait upon the King, and their interview with their liege
lord, is most naïvely described in chapter iii. The secret ballot at
Bury for three names was a surprise to the higher officials (31), and
they did what they could to diminish Samson's chances. But after some
fencing the Bishop of Winchester asked the deputation point blank whom
they wanted, and the answer was&mdash;Samson: "no one gainsaying this"
(34).</p>

<p><b>Samson as Abbot.</b>&mdash;And so the once oppressed and obscure monk
returned to Bury the absolute ruler of the foundation, with the king's
remark in his ears when he noted, with apparent admiration at Bishop's
Waltham, how Samson comported himself in the royal presence: "By the
eyes of God, this Abbot elect thinks himself worthy to govern an
abbey!" (35). So indeed he did, setting to work at once after his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxix" id="page_xxix">{xxix}</a></span>
ceremonial installation (37) to institute reforms of all sorts. As
Carlyle says, and his words must suffice in this place:&mdash;</p>

<p class="lgeblkquot"> How Abbot Samson, giving his new subjects
seriatim the kiss of fatherhood in the St. Edmundsbury chapter-house,
proceeded with cautious energy to set about reforming their
disjointed, distracted way of life; how he managed with his Fifty
rough Milites (Feudal Knights), with his lazy farmers, remiss
refractory monks, with Pope's Legates, Viscounts, Bishops, Kings; how
on all sides he laid about him like a man, and putting consequence on
premiss, and everywhere the saddle on the right horse, struggled
incessantly to educe organic method out of lazily fermenting
wreck,&mdash;the careful reader will discern, not without true interest, in
these pages of Jocelin Boswell.</p>

<p>To tell the story of all this would be to paraphrase the Chronicle;
and the reader is therefore referred to the List of Contents for
instances of the Abbot's capacity and resourcefulness in dealing with
the complicated interests under his control.</p>

<p>But there is one aspect of his busy life to which allusion may
perhaps here be made, as showing the influence and importance of the
Abbot of St. Edmundsbury outside the monastery walls.</p>

<p><b>Relations with Church and State.</b>&mdash;Samson's abbacy extended
over the pontificates of five Popes and the reigns of three Kings, by
all of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxx"
id="page_xxx">{xxx}</a></span> whom his strength of character and wisdom
of counsel seem to have been appreciated. Pope Lucius III., who had
succeeded, in 1181, Alexander III., to whom Samson had twenty years
before paid a visit on behalf of the Abbey (72), appointed the new
abbot a judge in the ecclesiastical courts within seven months of his
election (51). Urban III. granted Samson in 1187-8, the privilege of
giving the episcopal benediction (84) and other concessions. Celestine
III. placed him in 1197 on the commission for restoring the expelled
monks at Coventry (142); and Innocent III. granted on December 1,
1198, without hesitation, on Samson's application, an exemption of
Bury Abbey from episcopal visitation even by a legate unless he were a
legate <i>a latere</i> (124).</p>

<p>King Henry II., who had apparently formed a favourable opinion of
Samson from his demeanour on his election (35), practically decided in
his favour on February 11, 1187, in his dispute with Archbishop Hubert
concerning his abbatial jurisdiction over Monk's Eleigh, where a case
of homicide had occurred (78). In the same year, the king at Clarendon
favourably considered Samson's petition with reference to the immunity
of Bury Abbey from certain taxes (96). Having taken the Cross on
January 21, 1188, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxi"
id="page_xxxi">{xxxi}</a></span> Henry II. came to Bury within a month to
pay a pilgrimage to St. Edmund, when Samson endeavoured, without
success, to obtain the king's permission to do likewise (81).</p>

<p>In the next year Henry died at Chinon (July 6, 1189), and Samson
had to deal with a new sovereign: at whose coronation on September 3,
1189, he was present. One of Richard's earliest acts was the sale of
offices, crown rights, crown property, and royal favours to fill his
military chest; saying indeed that he would sell London if he could
find a purchaser. Amongst the bargains of this sort was the sale to
Samson of the manor of Mildenhall for 1,000 marks, after the astute
abbot had offered him half that amount (70). The queen-mother was
entitled by custom of the realm to 100 marks as a perquisite in
connection with this transaction, and took in lieu thereof a gold cup
which had been given to the abbey by Henry II. This same cup came back
to Bury in exchange for 100 marks (71), when the 70,000 marks required
to ransom King Richard was being raised in England (147).</p>

<p>When the news of Richard's capture reached England, Samson rose in
his place in the King's Council to express his readiness to seek the
king in Germany, either in disguise or any other way: "by reason
whereof," <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxii"
id="page_xxxii">{xxxii}</a></span> says Jocelin, "he obtained great
approbation" (81). Later on he did go to Germany, "and visited the
king with many gifts" (82).</p>

<p>Towards the end of Richard's reign, in 1198, Samson tried to avoid
sending four of his knights to Normandy, in obedience to the King's
orders, and went to see him, with the result that Richard accepted
four mercenaries, and afterwards a hundred pounds to discharge the
obligation (128-30). He brought back with him on this occasion for the
adornment of the abbey church a golden cross and a valuable copy of
the Gospels (130); and Jocelin records that so often as he returned
from beyond sea on his numerous visits abroad, he brought back with
him some offering for the church (131), besides making gifts to it on
other occasions.</p>

<p>In 1198 a serious quarrel took place between Richard and Samson
over the wardship of Nesta of Cockfield, the daughter of a family
whose tenure of lands from the Abbey is recorded with wearisome
iteration in the Chronicle. Samson would not give way, despite the
threats of the King, which he "very wisely passed over without
notice," and in the end Richard yielded with a good grace, asking the
abbot if he would send him some of his dogs. The abbot of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxiii" id="page_xxxiii">{xxxiii}</a></span>
course complied, and added some horses and other valuable gifts, in
exchange for which Richard sent him a ring given to him by the new
Pope, Innocent III. (147-9).</p>

<p>Just as Samson had "obtained the favour and grace of King Richard
by gifts and money, so that he had good reason to believe that he
could succeed in all his undertakings, the King died, and the abbot
lost all his labour and outlay" (178). It became therefore necessary
to propitiate Richard's successor. King John made an early pilgrimage
to St. Edmund, but left in bad odour with the monastery, which had
spent much money on his entertainment, but had only received in return
thirteenpence offered by the king at the shrine of the Saint on the
day of his departure, besides a silken cloth borrowed for the occasion
from the sacrist and never paid for (178). John must, however, have
thought highly of the abbot to summon him over sea in 1203 to confer
with him as to the Pope's letter concerning the dispensation of
Crusaders from their vows (207).</p>

<p><b>Samson as an Author.</b>&mdash;Once when Jocelin asked why he had
been sighing so heavily and was so wakeful at nights, Samson confided
to him how greatly he felt the burden of his charge; and on <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxiv" id="page_xxxiv">{xxxiv}</a></span>
another occasion said that if he had known what it involved, he would,
rather than be abbot and lord, have preferred to be keeper of the
books, "for this office he had ever desired above all others"
(55).</p>

<p>Jocelin hints a polite incredulity; but there are evidences that
Samson was fond of books, and was indeed an author. There is a small
volume, Titus A viii. in the Cottonian collection, which includes in
its contents a work in two books, entitled <i>De Miraculis Sancti
Ædmundi</i>. From a number of marginal notes, of even date with the
fourteenth century text, and which ascribe to Samson, amongst other
writers, the authorship of various passages in the great legendary
life of St. Edmund in the Bodleian Library (MS. 240), Mr. Arnold
arrived at the conclusion that "the writer of the work was
unquestionably Abbot Samson." For the evidence the reader is referred
to Appendix I. (pages 215-21); but it would appear that the work was
written before the date when he became abbot, and perhaps before he
had been appointed to any one of the numerous offices in the monastery
to which he was from time to time transferred by the capricious Hugh
(9).</p>

<p>Whenever any new event was recorded in his patron saint's honour,
Samson caused it to be recorded: <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_xxxv" id="page_xxxv">{xxxv}</a></span> hence at his desire the
episode of Henry of Essex, whom St. Edmund had "confounded in the very
hour of battle" (102), was reduced to writing at Reading, and
interpolated by some other monk in Jocelin's chronicle.</p>

<p><b>Samson's Masterfulness.</b>&mdash;Samson, like his prototype of
Scripture, was a "strong man," and as such he came into constant
conflict with those who sought to try conclusions with him, usually to
their own regret. From instances innumerable, the following may be
selected as typical. At his very first general court of his knights,
Thomas of Hastings tried to press the claim of his nephew Henry&mdash;a
minor&mdash;to the hereditary stewardship of the Abbey; but Samson said he
would consider the matter when Henry could perform the duties (41).
Richard, Earl of Clare, demanded his guerdon of five shillings for the
office of Standard-bearer of St. Edmund. Samson retorted that the
payment of the money would not inconvenience the Abbey; but there were
two other claimants for the post, and Richard must settle first with
them. The Earl said he would confer with Roger Bigot his kinsman, "and
so the matter was put off even to this day" (86).</p>

<p>Geoffrey Ridel, the Bishop of Ely, sent a blundering <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxvi" id="page_xxxvi">{xxxvi}</a></span>
messenger to the abbot to ask for timber from woods at Elmswell,
meaning Elmsett. Samson assented to the request for Elmswell, and
meanwhile sent his foresters to Elmsett and cut down a great quantity
of oaks, branding them as the property of the Abbey. The bishop
overwhelmed his stupid servant with reproaches, and sent him back to
explain. But it was too late, "and the bishop, if he wanted timber,
had to get it elsewhere" (107).</p>

<p>Herbert the dean erected a windmill upon the Haberdon, and tried to
brazen it out with Samson. But the abbot bade him begone, and told him
that before he had come to his house, he should hear what had befallen
his mill. Whereupon the trembling dean had the mill pulled down
himself, so that when the servants of the sacrist came to the spot,
they found their work already done for them (90).</p>

<p>In the domestic quarrel with his monks over the case of Ralph, the
gate porter, who had been punished by Robert the prior with the assent
of all the monastery, Samson upset the proceedings on his return from
London, and, after a violent struggle, got his own way (179-83).</p>

<p>There is a pleasing affectation of impartiality in the case of
another Herbert, the junior candidate for <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_xxxvii" id="page_xxxvii">{xxxvii}</a></span> the office of
Prior, on the much-worried Robert's death in 1200. The monks were
conscious that Samson "would seek the advice of each with great show
of formality," but that the affair would end as he had all along
intended (193). On the day of election the Precentor was egged on by
one of the elder brethren in an audible aside to nominate Herbert.
Samson behaved as if this was a new light to him, but offered no
objection to receive Herbert if the convent willed. And so, after a
protestation of his unworthiness, Herbert was elected (196); and
Jocelin tried, after these bare-faced proceedings, to recover his
equanimity in the porch of the guest-chamber (197).</p>

<p><b>Samson as an Administrator.</b>&mdash;Samson seems to have been
something of a financial genius; he certainly freed the monastery from
debt, and brought its internal affairs and its landed estates from
chaos into order. He was undoubtedly more of an administrator than an
ecclesiastic. He obviously enjoyed his ceremonial duties as
Commissioner for the King or for the Pope. He went to the siege of
Windsor in 1193 in martial array, though Jocelin is constrained to
admit that he was "more remarkable there for counsel than for piety"
(82). He appeared to be in his highest spirits when he went to
Coventry <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxviii"
id="page_xxxviii">{xxxviii}</a></span> in January, 1198, to help to
restore the monks there who had been ejected by their somewhat
truculent Bishop, Hugh de Nonant. Samson gave magnificent
entertainments at Oxford, where the Commission sat, and "never in his
life did he seem so joyful as at that time" (143).</p>

<p>He was fond, too, of country life, spending much time at his manors
of Melford and elsewhere, "enclosing many parks, which he replenished
with beasts of chase, and keeping a huntsman with dogs," though
Jocelin is careful to add that he "never saw him take part in the
sport" (43). With some of these dogs Samson appeased Richard's wrath
when he flouted the king as to a disputed wardship (149). One of the
complaints against him by those who chafed under his rule was that he
was fond of betaking himself to his manors, and Jocelin's excuse for
him is that "the abbot is more in spirits and in good humour elsewhere
than at home" (53). Jocelin took him to task over this, but had a text
from Ecclesiasticus hurled at his head, which induced him to "hold his
peace henceforth" (54).</p>

<p>With broader outlook than his obedientiaries, Samson recognized the
necessity of granting greater freedom to the inhabitants of the town
of Bury, and, despite <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxix"
id="page_xxxix">{xxxix}</a></span> the grumbling of his monks, he gave the
burgesses a Charter in 1194 (116). The resentment against him in the
monastery ran so high in 1199 that he professed to be afraid of his
life (182). Though matters were then patched up, the old feeling of
indignation against his concessions to the townsfolk endured, and an
occasion for manifesting it arose when, early in 1203, Samson was
summoned by King John to advise him on a brief sent by the Pope as to
the dispensation of certain Crusaders from their vows. To the
undisguised astonishment of Jocelin, Samson sought the advice of the
monastery, "a thing he heretofore had seldom done" (207); but he was
boldly asked what he proposed to do to get back the lost privileges of
the Abbey (210). He was then "weakened by infirmity of body, humbled,
and (as was not his wont) timid" (207); and it must be remembered that
he was by this time not far short of seventy years of age. He spoke
the monks fair, promised redress, and "that upon his return he would
co-operate with us in everything, and make just order and disposition,
and render to each what was justly his" (211).</p>

<p>Jocelin hints by a quotation from Ovid that there was some
apprehension that this promise would remain unfulfilled: and then in
Carlyle's words&mdash; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xl"
id="page_xl">{xl}</a></span></p>

<p class="lgeblkquot"> Jocelin's Boswellian narrative, suddenly shorn
through by the scissors of Destiny, ends. Impenetrable Time-curtains
rush down. Monks, Abbot, Hero-Worship, Government, Obedience, C&oelig;ur
de Lion, and St. Edmund's Shrine, vanish like Mirza's vision; and
there is nothing left but a mutilated black ruin amid green botanic
expanses.</p>

<p><b>Epilogue.</b>&mdash;As to what happened to Samson after he returned
from the visit to his sovereign, we have no information whatever from
any known source. Perhaps when he had reached the allotted span of
life, he came to feel that the time had arrived to take things more
easily, and to be less inelastic in his governance of the Abbey. The
last nine years of his chequered life are an absolute blank so far as
the available records are concerned, if we except his execution of
certain formal documents included in the Suffolk Feet of Fines. But
when at last, at the ripe age of 77, he died on the 30th December,
1211, at twilight (<i>inter lupum et canem</i>), on the night of the
feast of St. Thomas the Martyr, a tenderer feeling towards him
obviously existed amongst his monks.</p>

<p>The compiler of the <i>Annales Sancti Edmundi</i> (who from the
last phrase but one would seem to have been a contemporary) thus
records his decease:&mdash;</p>

<p class="lgeblkquot"> On the sixth day of Christmas, at St. Edmund's,
died Samson, of pious memory, the venerable abbot of this place. <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_xli" id="page_xli">{xli}</a></span> Who, after
he had for thirty years prosperously ruled the Abbey committed to him,
and had freed it from a load of debt,&mdash;had enriched it with
privileges, liberties, possessions, and spacious buildings, and had
restored the worship of the church, both internally and externally, in
the most ample manner, bidding his last farewell to his sons, by whom
the blessed man deserved to be blessed for evermore, while they all
were standing by, and gazing with awe at a death which was a cause for
admiration, not for regret (<i>non miserabilem sed mirabilem</i>), in
the fourth year of the interdict rested in peace (Arnold, ii. 19,
20).</p>

<p>"In the fourth year of the Interdict": there is a significance in
these words not perhaps immediately apparent. During the last few
years of Samson's life, public worship in his beloved abbey was
stopped; the altars were stripped, and the church doors closed, in
view of the interdict hurled at the recalcitrant John by the Pope in
March, 1208. More trying than this to the feelings of the age was the
requirement that the dead should be buried in silence and in
unconsecrated ground. So Samson was laid by his sorrowing monks in the
bosom of mother earth "in pratello," where he remained until after the
Interdict was removed in July, 1214. The writer of the <i>Electio
Hugonis</i> records, in barbarous Latin (Arnold, ii. 85), that on
August 9 of that year the sacrist raised the question as to the proper
interment of Samson "of venerable memory." <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_xlii" id="page_xlii">{xlii}</a></span> The prior (Herbert), the
cantor and Master Thomas of Walsingham, with other high officials,
thought Samson ought, for greater honour, to be buried in the Abbey
church. The sacrist&mdash;William of Gravelee, of whose uncompromising
character we have had a glimpse before&mdash;was alone in resisting this,
saying that so long as he had any power in the matter, neither Samson
nor any one else should be buried in the church. As the sacrist was
the responsible official this objection could apparently not be got
over, and so on August 12, 1214, the remains of Samson were exhumed,
and reburied in the chapter-house, which in the days of his life had
resounded to that eloquence of which Jocelin speaks (62).</p>

<p>What happened to the chapter house after the suppression of the
Abbey in 1539 is not known; but it seems probable that when the lead
of its roof was stripped off, it was left to crumble to decay by
itself, for some recent excavations in the winter of 1902-3 brought to
light quantities of beautifully worked stone, granite and marble
columns, and fragments of stained glass.</p>

<p>On New Year's Day of this year five stone coffins, each with a
skeleton within, and a sixth skeleton (uncoffined) were found under
the floor of the chapter-house <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xliii"
id="page_xliii">{xliii}</a></span> in the exact positions in which a MS.
of circa 1425, now preserved at Douai, records the burial places of
Samson, two of his predecessors, and three of his successors as
Abbots; and there can be no reasonable doubt therefore that those who,
like myself, were privileged to be associated with these excavations,
have gazed upon the mortal remains of one of the grandest and most
picturesque figures of Angevin times.<br /><br /></p>

<p>I am indebted to many friends for hints and suggestions in the
preparation of the Notes in Appendix II., especially to Lord Francis
Hervey, Dr. Montague R. James, and Mr. Francis Ford, all three of whom
have intimate personal knowledge of Bury St. Edmunds and its history.
In addition, Dr. James has been good enough to critically compare the
English text of the Chronicle with the Latin original, and has made
many valuable improvements, for which my especial thanks are due to
him. Mr. R. W. Chambers, M.A., Librarian of University College, has
also given me much assistance in the revision of the text in the
compilation of the Index.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smcap">bury abbey under abbot hugh</span></h2>


<p class="nodent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HAT which I have heard
and seen have I taken in hand to write, which in our days has come to
pass in the Church of St. Edmund, from the year when the Flemings were
taken captive without the town, at which time I took upon me the
religious habit, being the same year wherein prior Hugh was deposed,
and Robert made prior in his stead: and I have mingled in my narration
some evil deeds by way of warning, and some good by way of profit.</p>

<p>Now, at that time, Hugh the abbot was old, and his eyes were
somewhat dim. A pious and kind man was he, a good and religious monk,
yet not wise or far-sighted in worldly affairs; one who relied too
much on his officers, and put faith in them, rather taking counsel of
others than abiding by his own judgment.</p>

<p>To be sure, the Rule and the religious life, and all <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_2" id="page_2">{2}</a></span> pertaining
thereto were healthy enough in the cloister, but outdoor affairs were
badly managed; inasmuch as every one serving under a simple and
already aged lord did what he would, not what he should.</p>

<p>The townships of the abbot and all the hundreds were set to farm,
the forests were destroyed, the manor houses threatened to fall,
everything daily got worse and worse. One resource only the abbot had,
and that was to take up moneys on interest, so that thereby he might
be able in some measure to keep up the dignity of his house. There
befel not a term of Easter or St. Michael, for eight years before his
decease, but that one or two hundred pounds at least increased in
principal debt; the securities were always renewed, and the interest
which accrued was converted into principal.</p>

<p>This laxity descended from the head to the members, from the
superior to the subjects. Hence it came to pass that every official of
the house had a seal of his own, and bound himself in debt at his own
pleasure, to Jews as well as to Christians. Oftentimes silken copes
and golden cruetts, and other ornaments of the church, were pledged
without the knowledge of the convent. I myself saw a security passed
to William Fitz Isabel <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3"
id="page_3">{3}</a></span> for one thousand and forty pounds, but I never
could learn the consideration or the cause. I also saw another
security passed to Isaac, the son of Rabbi Joce, for four hundred
pounds, but I know not wherefore. I also saw a third security passed
to Benedict, the Jew of Norwich, for eight hundred and eighty pounds;
and this was the origin of that debt.</p>

<p>Our parlour was destroyed, and it was given in charge to William
the sacrist, will he, nill he, that he should restore it. He privily
borrowed from Benedict the Jew forty marks at interest, and gave him a
security sealed with a certain seal, which used to hang at the shrine
of St. Edmund, wherewith the gilds and letters of fraternity were wont
to be sealed: a seal which later on, but alas! too late, was broken by
order of the convent. Now, when this debt had increased to one hundred
pounds, the Jew came bearing a letter from our lord the King, touching
the debt of the sacrist; and then it was that all that had been secret
from the abbot and convent was laid bare.</p>

<p>The abbot waxed exceedingly wroth, and wished to depose the
sacrist, alleging that he possessed a privilege of our lord the pope,
giving him power of deposing William, his sacrist, whensoever it
pleased him. Howbeit, some one went to the abbot, and <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span> excusing the
sacrist, so wheedled the abbot that he permitted a security to be
passed to Benedict the Jew for four hundred pounds, payable at the end
of four years, namely, for one hundred pounds, which had then already
accrued for interest, and also for another hundred pounds, which the
same Jew had advanced to the sacrist for the use of the abbot. And the
sacrist in full chapter undertook for the whole of that debt to be
paid, and a deed was drawn up and sealed with the conventual seal: the
abbot dissimulating, and not affixing his own seal, as if that debt
was no concern of his.</p>

<p>But at the end of the four years, there were no means of
discharging the debt; and then a fresh deed was executed for eight
hundred and eighty pounds, payable at set terms, at the rate of eighty
pounds a year. Moreover, the same Jew had many other securities of
smaller account, and one which was for fourteen years; so this debt
alone came to one thousand and two hundred pounds, besides the
interest that had accrued.</p>

<p>Now R., the almoner of our lord the King, coming to us, signified
to the abbot that such and such information had reached the King
concerning such and such debts. Thereupon, after consultation had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span> between the
prior and a few others, the almoner was conducted into the chapter
house, where all of us being seated, and holding our peace, the abbot
said, "Look you, here is the King's almoner, our and your lord and
friend, who, moved by the love of God and of St. Edmund, has intimated
to us that the King has heard something wrong of us and you, and
particularly that the affairs of the church, both internally and
externally, are being badly managed; and therefore I desire and
command that, upon your vow of obedience, ye state and explain openly
how things really are." Hereupon the prior, standing up and speaking
as one for all, said that the church was in good order, that the Rule
was strictly and religiously observed indoors, and that matters out of
doors were carefully and discreetly conducted, save some slight debt,
in which ourselves, like our neighbours, were involved; but that, in
fact, there was no debt which could embarrass us. The almoner, hearing
this, said he was rejoiced that he had heard the testimony of the
convent concerning this matter: meaning, what the prior had said.</p>

<p>The very same words the prior upon another occasion used, as did
Master Geoffry of Constantine, speaking on behalf of and excusing the
abbot, when <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span>
Richard the archbishop, in virtue of his office as legate, visited our
chapter, before we had such exemption as we now enjoy.</p>

<p>I myself, who was at that time a novice, on a convenient occasion,
talked these things over with the master who instructed me in the
Rule, and to whose care I was committed,&mdash;namely, Master Samson, who
afterwards became abbot. "What is this," I said, "that I hear? How can
you hold your tongue while you see and hear such things, you who are a
cloistered monk, and desire not offices, and fear God more than man?"
But he answering, said, "My son, the newly burnt child dreads the
fire; so it is with me and many others. Hugh, the prior, has been
lately deprived of his office and sent into exile; Dennis and Hugh and
Roger of Hengham have but lately returned home from exile. Even I, in
like manner, was imprisoned, and afterwards sent to Acre, because we
spoke for the good of our church, in opposition to the abbot. This is
the hour of darkness; this is the time when flatterers rule and are
believed, and their might is strengthened, and we can do nothing
against it; these things must be borne with for a time. 'Let the Lord
look upon it and judge.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span> Now a
rumour reached Abbot Hugh that Richard, Archbishop of Canterbury,
proposed coming to make a visitation of our church by virtue of his
authority as legate; and thereupon the abbot, after consultation, sent
to Rome and sought a privilege of exemption from the power of the
aforesaid legate. On the messenger's return from Rome there was not
wherewith to discharge what he had promised to our lord the pope and
the cardinals, except, indeed, under the special circumstances of the
case, the cross which was over the high altar, the little image of the
Virgin, and the St. John (which images archbishop Stigand had adorned
with a vast quantity of gold and silver, and had given to St.
Edmund).</p>

<p>There were certain of our convent who, being on terms of intimacy
with the abbot, said that the shrine of St. Edmund itself ought to be
stripped, as the means of obtaining such a privilege. But these
persons did not consider the great peril that the possession of such a
privilege might entail; for if there should hereafter be any abbot of
ours who chose to waste the possessions of the church, and to despoil
his convent, then there would be no one to whom the convent could
complain touching the wrongs <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8"
id="page_8">{8}</a></span> done by an abbot, as he would have no reason to
fear a bishop, archbishop, or legate, and his impunity would lend him
the courage to transgress.</p>

<p>In these days the cellarer, as well as other officials, borrowed
moneys at interest from Jurnet the Jew (without apprising the
convent), upon a security sealed with the above-mentioned seal. Now,
when that debt had mounted up to sixty pounds, the convent was
summoned to pay the cellarer's debt. The cellarer was deposed,
although he said it was hard to deal thus with him, stating that for
three years he had entertained in the guest-house by the abbot's
orders, whether the abbot were in residence or not, all the guests
which the abbot ought himself to entertain, according to the rule of
the abbey.</p>

<p>Master Dennis was made cellarer in his stead, and by his
circumspection and good management he reduced the debt of sixty pounds
to thirty pounds; towards which debt we applied those thirty marks
which Benedict of Blakenham gave to the convent for holding the manors
of Nowton and Whepsted. But the securities of the Jew have remained
with the Jew even to this day, wherein are contained the twenty-six
pounds of principal and interest of the cellarer's debt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span>
Now, on the third day after Master Dennis became cellarer, three
knights with their esquires were received in the guest-house that they
might there be refreshed, the abbot then being at home, and abiding in
his inner chamber; all which, when this great-souled Achilles had
heard, not willing to pay toll in his own domain, as the others had
done, he rose up and took the key of the cellar, and taking with him
those knights to the abbot's hall, and approaching the abbot, said,
"My lord, you well know that the rule of the abbey is, that knights
and lay folk should be entertained in your hall, if the abbot be at
home. I neither will nor can receive those guests whom it belongs to
you to entertain; else take back the keys of your cellar, and appoint
some other cellarer at your good pleasure." The abbot hearing this,
nill he, will he, entertained those knights, and ever afterwards
entertained knights and lay folk according to the ancient rule, and so
they are still received when the abbot is at home.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, Abbot Hugh, wishing to conciliate Master Samson,
appointed him sub-sacrist; and he, often accused, was often
transferred from one office to another. At one time he was appointed
guest-master, at another time pittance-master, at <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span> another time
third prior, and again sub-sacrist; and many were then his enemies who
afterwards flattered him. But he, not acting as the other officials
did, never could be induced to turn flatterer; whereupon the abbot
said that he had never seen a man whom he could not bend to his will,
except Samson the sub-sacrist.</p>

<p>In the twenty-third year of his abbacy, Abbot Hugh bethought him
that he would go to St. Thomas for the purpose of performing his
devotions. He had nearly got to the end of his journey, on the morrow
of the nativity of the Blessed Mary, when, near Rochester, he most
unhappily fell from his horse, so that his knee-pan was put out and
lodged in the ham of his knee. The physicians came about him, and
sorely tormented him, but they healed him not. He was brought back to
us in a horse-litter, and received with great attention, as was most
fitting. What more? His leg mortified, and the disorder mounted to his
heart. The pain brought on a tertian fever, and on the fourth fit he
expired, and rendered his soul to God on the morrow of St. Brice.</p>

<p>Ere he was dead, everything was snatched away by his servants, so
that nothing at all remained <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11"
id="page_11">{11}</a></span> in the abbot's house except the stools and
the tables, which could not be carried away. There was hardly left for
the abbot his coverlet and two quilts, old and torn, which some, who
had taken away the good ones, had placed in their stead. There was not
even a single article of a penny's worth that could be distributed
among the poor for the good of his soul.</p>

<p>The sacrist said it was not his business to have attended to this,
alleging that he had furnished the expenditure of the abbot and his
household for one whole month, because neither the firmars who held
the vills would pay anything before the appointed time, nor would
creditors advance anything, seeing that he was sick even unto
death.</p>

<p>Luckily, the farmer of Palgrave furnished us with fifty shillings
to be distributed among the poor, by reason that he entered upon the
farm of Palgrave on that same day. But those very fifty shillings were
afterwards again refunded to the King's bailiffs, who demanded the
whole farm-rent for the King's use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span><br /></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smcap">the monks discuss the vacancy</span></h2>


<p class="nodent"><span class="dropcap">H</span>UGH the abbot being
buried, it was ordered in chapter that some one should give
intelligence to Ranulf de Glanville, the justiciar of England, of the
death of the abbot. Master Samson and Master R. Ruffus, our monks,
quickly went beyond seas, to report the same fact to our lord the
King, and obtained letters that those possessions and rents of the
monastery, which were distinct from those of the abbot, should be
wholly in the hands of the prior and convent, and that the remainder
of the abbey should be in the hands of the King. The wardship of the
abbey was committed to Robert of Cockfield and Robert of Flamville,
the steward, who forthwith put by gage and safe pledges all those
servants and relatives of the abbot to whom the abbot had, after the
commencement of his illness, given anything, or who had taken anything
away belonging to the abbot, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13"
id="page_13">{13}</a></span> also the abbot's chaplain (a monk of the
house), whom the prior bailed. Entering into our vestiary, they caused
all the ornaments of the church to be noted down in an inventory.</p>

<p>During the vacancy in the abbacy, the prior, above all things,
studied to keep peace in the convent, and to preserve the honour of
the church in entertaining guests, being desirous of irritating no
one, of not provoking anybody to anger; in fact, of keeping all
persons and things in quietude. He nevertheless winked at some acts in
our officials which needed reformation, and especially in the sacrist,
as if he cared not how that officer dealt with the sacristy. Yet
during the vacancy, the sacrist neither satisfied any debt nor erected
any building, but the oblations and incomings were foolishly frittered
away.</p>

<p>Wherefore the prior, who was the head of the convent, seemed by the
greater part to be highly censurable, and was said to be remiss; and
this thing our brethren called to mind among themselves, when it came
to the point of making choice of an abbot.</p>

<p>Our cellarer entertained all guests, of whatsoever condition they
were, at the expense of the convent. William the sacrist, on his part,
gave and spent as <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14"
id="page_14">{14}</a></span> he chose, kind man! giving alike what he
should and should not; "blinding the eyes of all with gifts."</p>

<p>Samson the sub-sacrist, being master over the workmen, did his best
that no breach, chink, crack or flaw should be left unrepaired so far
as he was able; whereby he acquired great favour with the convent, and
especially with the cloister monks. In those days our choir was
erected by Samson's exertion; and he arranged the order of the
paintings, and composed elegiac verses for them. He also made a great
draught of stone and sand for building the great tower of the church.
Being asked whence he procured the money for his work, he answered
that certain of the burgesses had privily given him moneys for
building and completing the tower.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, certain of our brethren said that Warin, a monk of
our house and keeper of the shrine, together with Samson the
sub-sacrist, had conspired to remove some portion of the offerings to
the shrine, in order that they might disburse the same for the
necessary purposes of the church, and in particular for the building
of the tower; being the more ready to believe this when they saw that
the offerings were expended for extraordinary purposes by others, who,
to speak plainly, stole them. And these before-named <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span>two men, in
order to remove from themselves the suspicion of any such pious theft,
made a certain hollow trunk, with a hole in the middle or at the top,
and fastened with an iron lock. This they caused to be set up in the
great church, near the door without the choir, where the common people
usually pass, so that persons should put their contributions therein
for the building of the tower.</p>

<p>Now William the sacrist had a jealousy of his companion Samson, as
had many others who took part with the same William, Christians as
well as Jews; the Jews, I say, to whom the sacrist was said to be
father and protector, whose protection they indeed enjoyed, having
free ingress and egress, and going all over the monastery, rambling
about the altars and by the shrine while high mass was being
celebrated. Moreover, their moneys were kept safe in our treasury,
under the care of the sacrist, and, what was still more improper,
their wives with their little ones were lodged in our pittancy in time
of war. His enemies or opponents having, therefore, consulted together
how they might suddenly overcome Samson, they conferred with Robert of
Cockfield and his colleague, who were wardens of <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span>the abbey, and persuaded them
to this&mdash;that they should, on behalf of the King, forbid any one to
erect any fabric or building so long as the abbacy was vacant; but
that, on the other hand, the moneys from the offerings should be
collected, and kept for the purpose of discharging some debt.</p>

<p>And thus was Samson beguiled, and his "strength departed from him,"
nor could he from thenceforth labour as he had desired. Indeed, his
opponents were able to delay, but not annul, his purpose; for having
regained his strength, and "pulled down the two pillars," that is,
having removed the two wardens of the abbey, upon whom the malice of
others relied, the Lord gave him, in process of time, the means of
fulfilling his desire of building the aforesaid tower, and of
finishing it even as he wished. And so it was, as if it had been said
to him from above, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant; thou
hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many
things."</p>

<p>During the time that the abbacy was vacant we oftentimes, as was
our duty, besought God and the holy martyr St. Edmund that they would
vouchsafe to us and our church a meet shepherd, thrice every week
singing the seven penitential psalms prostrate in the choir, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span>after going
forth from chapter. There were some amongst us who, had it been known
who was to be abbot, would not have prayed so devoutly.</p>

<p>As concerned the choice of an abbot, assuming the King gave us free
election, divers men spoke in divers ways&mdash;some publicly, some
privately; and "so many men, so many opinions."</p>

<p>One said of another, "That brother is a good monk, a likely person;
he is well conversant with the Rule and custom of the house; although
he may not be so perfect a philosopher as certain others, he would
make a very good abbot. Abbot Ording was not a learned man, and yet he
was a good abbot, and governed this house wisely: we read, too, in the
fable, that it had been better for the frogs to have chosen a log for
a king, upon whom they might rely, than a serpent, who venomously
hissed, and after his hisses devoured his subjects."</p>

<p>Another would answer, "How may this be? How can an unlearned man
deliver a sermon in chapter, or to the people on festivals? How can he
who does not understand the Scriptures attain the knowledge of
'binding and loosing'? seeing that the cure of souls is the art of
arts and science of sciences. God forbid that a dumb image should be
set up in the Church <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18"
id="page_18">{18}</a></span>of St. Edmund, where many learned and studious
men are well known to be."</p>

<p>Also said one of another, "That brother is a good clerk, eloquent
and careful, strict in the Rule; he has much loved the convent, and
has undergone many hardships in respect of the possessions of the
church: he is worthy to be made abbot." Another answered, "From good
clerks, Good Lord, deliver us: that it may please Thee to preserve us
from the barrators of Norfolk, we beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord."
Moreover, one said of another, "That brother is a good manager, which
is proved from his department, and from the offices which he has well
served, and by the buildings and reparations which he has performed.
He is able to travail for and defend the house, and is, moreover,
something of a clerk, although 'much learning has not made him mad':
he is worthy to be made abbot." Another answered, "God forbid that a
man who can neither read nor chant, nor perform Divine service&mdash;a
wicked and unjust man, and a grinder of the faces of the poor&mdash;should
be abbot."</p>

<p>Also said one of another, "That brother is a kind man, affable and
amiable, peaceful and well-regulated, open-hearted and liberal, a
learned man and an <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19"
id="page_19">{19}</a></span>eloquent, a proper man enough in looks and
deportment, and beloved by many, indoors as well as out; and such a
man might, with God's permission, become abbot to the great honour of
the church." The other answered, "It is no honour, but rather a
burden, to have a man who is too nice in his meat and drink; who
thinks it a virtue to sleep long; who is expert in spending much, and
yet gets little; who is snoring when others are awake; who always is
desirous to be in plenty, nor yet cares for the debts which increase
from day to day, nor considers the means of discharging expenses;
hating anxiety and trouble; caring for nought so long as one day comes
and another goes; a man cherishing and fostering flatterers and liars;
a man who is one thing in name and another in deed. From such a
prelate defend us, O Lord!"</p>

<p>Also said a certain one of his fellow, "That man is almost wiser
than all of us put together, both in secular and ecclesiastical
matters; a wonderful counsellor, strict in rule, learned and eloquent,
and of proper stature; such a prelate would do honour to our
church."</p>

<p>The other answered, "True, if he were of known and approved
reputation. His character is questionable; report may lie, or it may
not. And although the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20"
id="page_20">{20}</a></span>man you mean is wise, of lowly carriage in
chapter, devout in psalmody, strict in the cloister whilst he is in
the cloister, yet it is mere outward show with him. What if he do
excel in any office? He is too scornful, lightly esteems the monks, is
closely intimate with secular persons; and should he be angry,
scarcely returns an answer with a good grace to any brother, or to one
even asking a question of him."</p>

<p>I heard in like manner one brother disparaged by some, because he
was slow of speech; of whom it was said that he had paste or malt in
his mouth when he was called upon to speak. And as for myself, being
at that time a youth, "I understood as a youth, I spoke as a youth;"
and said I never could consent that any one should be made abbot
unless he knew somewhat of dialectics, and knew how to discern truth
from falsehood. Again, a certain person, who in his own eyes seemed
very wise, said, "May the almighty Lord bestow on us a foolish and
simple shepherd, so that it should be the more needful for him to get
help from us!"</p>

<p>I heard in like manner a certain studious and learned man, and
honourable by the nobility of his family, disparaged by some of our
seniors merely for this reason&mdash;because he was a novice. The novices,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span>on the
other hand, said of the elders, that old men were valetudinarians, by
no means fit to govern a monastery. And thus many persons spoke many
things, "and each was fully persuaded in his own mind."</p>

<p>I observed Samson the sub-sacrist as he was sitting along with the
others at blood-letting season (at which time monks are wont to reveal
to each other the secrets of the heart, and to talk over matters with
each other). I saw him, I say, sitting along with the others, smiling
and saying nothing, but noting the words of each, and after a lapse of
twenty years calling to mind some of the before-written opinions. In
whose hearing I used to reply to these critics, that if we were to put
off the choice of an abbot until we found one who was above
disparagement or fault, we never should find such a one, for no one
alive is without fault, and "no estate is in all respects
blessed."</p>

<p>Upon one particular occasion I was unable to restrain myself but
must needs blurt out my own private opinion, thinking that I spoke to
trusty ears. I then said that a certain person who formerly had a
great regard for me, and had conferred many benefits upon me, was
unworthy of the abbacy, and that another was more worthy; in fact, I
named one for whom I had less regard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span>I
spoke according to my own conscience, rather considering the common
weal of the church than my own advancement; and what I said was true,
as the sequel proved. And, behold, one of the sons of Belial disclosed
my saying to my friend and benefactor; for which reason, even to this
day, never could I since, neither by entreaty nor good offices, regain
his goodwill to the full. "What I have said I have said." "And the
word once spoken flies without recall."</p>

<p>One thing remains, that I take heed to my ways for the future; and
if I should live so long as to see the abbacy vacant, I shall consider
carefully what, to whom, and when I speak on such a matter, lest I
either offend God by lying, or man by speaking unreasonably. I shall
then advise (should I last so long), that we choose not too good a
monk, nor yet an over-wise clerk, neither one too simple nor too weak;
lest, if he be over wise in his own conceit, he may be too confident
in his own judgment, and contemn others; or, if he be too boorish, he
may become a byword to others; I know that it has been said, "In the
middle you will be safest," also that "Blessed are they who hold a
middle course."</p>

<p>Perhaps, after all, it may be the best course to <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span>hold my peace
altogether, and say in my heart, "He that is able to receive it, let
him receive it."</p>

<p>The abbacy being vacant, Augustine, the Archbishop of Norway, took
up his abode with us, in the house of the abbot, receiving by the
King's precept ten shillings a day from the revenues of the abbey. He
was of considerable assistance in obtaining for us our free election,
bearing witness of what was well, and publicly declaring before the
King what he had seen and heard.</p>

<p>At that time the holy child Robert suffered martyrdom, and was
buried in our church; and many signs and wonders were wrought among
the people, as we have elsewhere written.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span><br /></p>


<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smcap">the choice of a new abbot</span></h2>


<p class="nodent"><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE year and three
months having elapsed since the death of Abbot Hugh, the King
commanded by his letters that our prior and twelve of the convent, in
whose mouth the judgment of our body might agree, should appear on a
certain day before him, to make choice of an abbot. On the morrow,
after the receipt of the letters, we all of us met in chapter for the
purpose of discussing so important a matter. In the first place the
letters of our lord the King were read to the convent; next we
besought and charged the prior, at the peril of his soul, that he
would, according to his conscience, name twelve who were to accompany
him, from whose life and conversation it might be depended upon that
they would not swerve from the right; who, acceding to our charge, by
the dictation of the Holy Ghost named six from one side and six from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span> the
other side of the choir, and without gainsaying satisfied us on this
point. From the right-hand choir were named&mdash;Geoffrey of Fordham,
Benedict, Master Dennis, Master Samson the sub-sacrist, Hugh the third
prior, and Master Hermer, at that time a novice; from the left-hand
side&mdash;William the sacrist, Andrew, Peter de Broc, Roger the cellarer,
Master Ambrose, Master Walter the physician.</p>

<p>But one said, "What shall be done if these thirteen cannot agree
before our lord the King in the choice of an abbot?" A certain one
answered that that would be to us and to our church a perpetual shame.
Therefore, many were desirous that the choice should be made at home
before the rest departed, so that by this forecast there should be no
disagreement in the presence of the King. But that seemed a foolish
and inconsistent thing to do, without the King's assent; for as yet it
was by no means a settled thing that we should be able to obtain a
free election from the King.</p>

<p>Then said Samson the sub-sacrist, speaking by the spirit of God,
"Let there be a middle course, so that from either side peril may be
avoided. Let four confessors be chosen from the convent, together with
two of the senior priors of the convent, men of <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_26" id="page_26">{26}</a></span> good reputation, who, in the
presence of the holy relics, shall lay their hands upon the Gospels,
and choose amongst themselves three men of the convent most fit for
this office, according to the rule of St. Benedict, and put their
names into writing. Let them close up that writing with a seal, and so
being closed up, let it be committed to us who are about to go to the
court. When we shall have come before the King, and it shall appear
that we are to have a free election, then, and not till then, shall
the seal be broken, and so shall we be sure as to the three who are to
be nominated before the King. And let it be agreed amongst us, that in
case our lord the King shall not grant to us one of ourselves, then
the seal shall be brought back intact, and delivered to the six under
oath, so that this secret of theirs shall remain for ever concealed,
at the peril of their souls." In this counsel we all acquiesced, and
four confessors were then named; namely, Eustace, Gilbert of Alveth,
Hugh the third prior, Anthony, and two other old men, Thurstan and
Ruald. Which being done, we went forth chanting "Verba mea," and the
aforesaid six remained behind, having the rule of St. Benedict in
their hands; and they fulfilled that business as it had been
pre-ordained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span> Now,
whilst these six were treating of their matter, we were thinking
differently of different candidates, all of us taking it for granted
that Samson would be one of the three, considering his travails and
perils of death in his journey to Rome for the advancement of our
church, and how he was badly treated and put in irons and imprisoned
by Hugh the abbot, merely for speaking for the common weal; for he
could not be induced to flatter, although he might be forced to hold
his tongue.</p>

<p>After some delay, the convent being summoned returned to chapter;
and the old men said they had done as they were commanded. Then the
prior asked, "How shall it be if our lord the King will not receive
any of those three who are nominated in the writing?" And it was
answered that whomsoever our lord the King should be willing to accept
should be adopted, provided he were a professed monk of our house. It
was further added, that if those thirteen brethren should see anything
that ought to be amended by another writing, they should so amend it
by common assent or counsel.</p>

<p>Samson the sub-sacrist, sitting at the feet of the prior, said, "It
will be profitable for the church if <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span> we all swear by the word of
truth that upon whomsoever the lot of election shall fall, he should
treat the convent according to reason, nor change the chief officers
without the assent of the convent, nor surcharge the sacrist, nor
admit any one to be a monk without assent of the convent." And to this
we all of us assented, holding up our right hands in token of assent.
It was, moreover, provided, that if our lord the King should desire to
make a stranger our abbot, such person should not be adopted by the
thirteen, unless upon counsel of the brethren remaining at home.</p>

<p>Upon the morrow, therefore, those thirteen took their way to court.
Last of all was Samson, the purveyor of their charges, because he was
sub-sacrist, carrying about his neck a little box, in which were
contained the letters of the convent&mdash;as if he alone was the servant
of them all&mdash;and without an esquire, bearing his frock in his arms,
and going out of the court, he followed his fellows at a distance.</p>

<p>In their journey to the court, the brethren conversing all
together, Samson said that it would be well if they all swore that
whosoever should be made abbot should restore the churches of the
lordships belonging to the convent to the purposes <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span> of
hospitality; whereto all agreed, save the prior, who said, "We have
sworn enough already; you may so restrict the abbot that is to be,
that I shall not care to obtain the abbacy." Upon this occasion they
swore not at all, and it was well they did so, for had they sworn to
this, the oath would not have been observed.</p>

<p>On the very day that the thirteen departed we were all sitting
together in the cloister, when William of Hastings, one of our
brethren, said, "I know that we shall have one of our convent to be
abbot." And being asked how he came to be so certain of this, he
replied, that he had beheld in a dream a prophet clothed in white,
standing before the gates of the monastery, and that he asked him, in
the name of God, whether we should have an abbot of our own. And the
prophet answered, "You shall have one of your own body, but he shall
rage among you as a wolf"; of which dream the interpretation followed
in part, because the future abbot cared more to be feared than loved,
as many were accustomed to say.</p>

<p>There also sat along with us another brother, Edmund by name, who
asserted that Samson was about to be abbot, and told a vision he had
seen the previous night. He said he beheld in his dream Roger the
cellarer and Hugh the third prior, standing <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span> before the altar, and Samson
in the midst, taller by the shoulders upward, wrapt round with a long
gown down to his feet, looped over his shoulders, and standing as a
champion ready to do battle. And, as it seemed to him in his dream,
St. Edmund arose from his shrine, and, as if sickly, showed his feet
and legs bare. When some one approached and desired to cover the feet
of the saint, the saint said, "Approach me not; behold, he shall veil
my feet," pointing with his finger towards Samson. This is the
interpretation of the dream: By his seeming to be a champion is
signified that the future abbot should always be in travail; at one
time moving a controversy against the Archbishop of Canterbury,
concerning pleas of the Crown, at another time against the knights of
St. Edmund, to compel them to pay their escuages in full; at another
time with the burgesses for standing in the market; at another time
with the sokemen for the suits of the hundreds; even as a champion who
willeth by fighting to overcome his adversaries that he may be able to
gain the rights and liberties of his church. And he veiled the feet of
the holy martyr when he perfectly completed the towers of the church,
commenced a hundred years before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">{31}</a></span> Such
dreams as these did our brethren dream, which were immediately
published throughout the cloister, afterwards through the court lodge,
so that before the evening it was a matter of common talk amongst the
townsfolk, they saying this man and that man are elected, and one of
them will be abbot.</p>

<p>At last the prior and the twelve that were with him, after many
fatigues and delays, stood before the King at Waltham, the manor of
the Bishop of Winchester, upon the second Sunday in Lent. The King
graciously received them; and, saying that he wished to act in
accordance with the will of God and the honour of our church,
commanded the brethren by prolocutors&mdash;namely, Richard the Bishop of
Winchester, and Geoffrey the chancellor, afterwards Archbishop of
York&mdash;that they should nominate three members of our convent.</p>

<p>The prior and brethren retiring as if to confer thereupon, drew
forth the sealed writing and opened it, and found the names written in
this order&mdash;Samson, sub-sacrista; Roger, celerarius; Hugo, tercius
prior. Hereupon those brethren who were of higher standing blushed
with shame; they also marvelled that this same Hugh should be at once
elector and elected. But, inasmuch as they could <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span> not alter what was done, by
mutual arrangement they changed the order of the names; first naming
Hugh, because he was third prior; secondly, Roger the cellarer;
thirdly, Samson, thus literally making the last first and the first
last.</p>

<p>The King, first inquiring whether they were born in his realm, and
in whose lordship, said he knew them not, directing that with those
three, some other three of the convent should be nominated. This being
assented to, William the sacrist said, "Our prior ought to be
nominated because he is our head," which was directly allowed. The
prior said, "William the sacrist is a good man"; the like was said of
Dennis, and that was settled. These being nominated before the King
without any delay, the King marvelled, saying, "These men have been
speedy in their work; God is with them."</p>

<p>Next the King commanded that, for the honour of his kingdom, they
should name three persons of other houses. On hearing this, the
brethren were afraid, suspecting some craft. At last, upon conference,
it was resolved that they should name three, but upon this
understanding, that they would not receive any one of those three,
unless by assent of the convent at home. And they named these
three&mdash;Master <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33"
id="page_33">{33}</a></span> Nicholas of Waringford, afterwards (for a
season) Abbot of Malmesbury; Bertrand, Prior of St. Faith's,
afterwards Abbot of Chertsey; and Master H. of St. Neot's, a monk of
Bec, a man highly religious, and very circumspect in spiritual as well
as temporal affairs.</p>

<p>This being done, the King thanked them, and ordered that three
should be struck off of the nine; and forthwith the three strangers
were struck off, namely, the Prior of St. Faith's, afterwards Abbot of
Chertsey, Nicholas, a monk of St. Albans, afterwards Abbot of
Malmesbury, and the Prior of St. Neot's. William the sacrist
voluntarily retired, two of the five were struck out by command of the
King, and, ultimately, one out of the remaining three. There then
remained but two, the prior and Samson.</p>

<p>Then at length the before-named prolocutors of our lord the King
were called to the council of the brethren: and Dennis, speaking as
one for all, began by commending the persons of the prior and Samson,
saying, that each of them was learned, each was good, each was of
meritorious life and good character. But always in the corner of his
discourse he gave prominence to Samson, multiplying words in his
praise, saying that he was a man strict in life, severe in reforming
excesses, and ready <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34"
id="page_34">{34}</a></span> to work hard; heedful, moreover, in secular
matters, and approved in various offices. The Bishop of Winchester
replied, "We see what it is you wish to say; from your address we
gather that your prior seems to you to have been somewhat remiss, and
that, in fact, you wish to have him who is called Samson." Dennis
answered, "Either of them is good, but, by God's help, we desire to
have the best." To whom the bishop, "Of two good men the better should
be chosen. Speak out at once; is it your wish to have Samson?"
Whereupon several, in fact the majority, answered clearly, "We do wish
Samson." No one gainsaid this, though some studiously held their
peace, being fearful of offending either one or the other.</p>

<p>Samson was then named to the King, and after a brief consultation
with those about him, the King called all in, and said, "You present
to me Samson&mdash;I know him not; had you presented to me your prior, I
should have accepted him, because I know and am well acquainted with
him; but now I will do as you desire me. Take heed to yourselves; by
the very eyes of God, if you have done ill, I shall call you to severe
account." And he inquired of the prior, whether he assented to this
choice and agreed <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35"
id="page_35">{35}</a></span> thereto; who replied that he was well content
it should be so, and that Samson was worthy of a much greater
dignity.</p>

<p>Then the elect, falling down at the King's feet and kissing them,
hastily arose, and forthwith went towards the altar, erect in gait,
and with unmoved countenance, singing "Miserere mei Deus," together
with his brethren.</p>

<p>The King, observing this, said to the bystanders, "By the eyes of
God, this abbot-elect thinks himself worthy to govern an abbey!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36" id="page_36">{36}</a></span><br /></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smcap">samson's installation</span></h2>


<p class="nodent"><span class="dropcap">N</span>OW when the news of
the election arrived at the monastery, it gladdened all the cloister
monks and some of the officers also, but only a few. "It is well,"
many said, "because it is well." Others said, "Not so; verily we are
all deceived." The elect, before he returned to us, received his
benediction from my lord of Winchester, who, at the same time, placing
the mitre on the head of the abbot, and the ring on his finger, said,
"This is the dignity of the abbots of St. Edmund; my experience long
since taught me this." The abbot, therefore, keeping three monks with
him, despatched the others homewards, sending word by them of his
intended arrival on Palm Sunday, and giving charge to certain of them
to provide the things necessary for his day of festival.</p>

<p>As he returned homewards, a multitude of new <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span> relations came about him
offering to serve him, but he answered all of them that he was content
with the servants of the prior, nor could he retain others until he
had obtained the assent of the convent. Nevertheless, he retained one
knight who was well spoken and learned in the law, not so much upon
the score of relationship, but on account of his usefulness, he being
well practised in secular suits.</p>

<p>This knight he took, while he was fresh to the work, as an assessor
in secular controversies; for he was a new abbot, and inexperienced in
such concerns, as he himself was free to declare: indeed, before he
received the abbacy, he had never been present where gage and safe
pledge had been given.</p>

<p>With the accustomed honours, and with a procession, was he received
by his convent on Palm Sunday. The abbot's reception was in this wise:
overnight he lay at Kentford, and we, at the proper moment, went forth
from the chapter-house to meet him with great solemnity, up to the
gate of the cemetery, with ringing of bells inside the choir and
without. He himself was surrounded by a multitude of men, and when he
espied the fraternity, he dismounted from his horse outside the
threshold of the gate. Causing his shoes to be taken off, he was
received <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38">{38}</a></span>
barefooted within the door, and conducted on each side by the prior
and sacrist.</p>

<p>We chanted the responses "Benedictus Dominus," in the office of the
Trinity, and then "Martyri adhuc," in the office of St. Edmund,
leading the abbot up to the high altar. This being finished, the
organs and bells were silenced, and the prayer, "Omnipotens sempiterne
Deus miserere huic," was said by the prior over the abbot, who was
prostrate. An offering was then made by the abbot, and kissing the
shrine, he returned into the choir. There Samson the precentor took
him by the hand and led him to the abbot's throne at the west end;
where, the abbot still standing, the precentor straight-way began, "Te
Deum laudamus," and whilst this was being sung, the abbot was kissed
by the prior and the whole convent in order. This done, the abbot
proceeded to the chapter-house, the whole convent following him, with
many others.</p>

<p>"Benedicite" having been said, in the first place he gave thanks to
the convent that they had chosen him&mdash;who was, he said, the least of
them all&mdash;to be their lord and shepherd, not on account of his own
merits, but solely by the will of God. And beseeching them briefly
that they would pray for him, he <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39"
id="page_39">{39}</a></span> addressed his discourse to the clerks and
knights, requiring them that they should assist him with their advice
according to the burden of the charge entrusted to him. And Wimer the
sheriff, answering for them all, said, "We are ready to stand by you
in counsel and assistance on every occasion, as we did by our dear
lord whom God has called to his glory, and to the glory of the holy
martyr St. Edmund." And then were the charters of the King concerning
the gift of the abbacy produced and read in full audience. Lastly,
after a prayer by the abbot himself, that God might guide him
according to his Divine grace, and "Amen" being responded by all, he
retired to his chamber, spending his day of festival with more than a
thousand dinner guests with great rejoicing.</p>

<p>While these things were taking place I was the prior's chaplain,
and within four months was made the abbot's chaplain, noting many
things, and committing them to memory. On the morrow of his feast the
abbot called to him the prior and some few besides, as if seeking
advice from others, though he himself knew what he would do. He said
that a new seal should be made with a mitred effigy of him, although
his predecessors had not the like; but for a time he <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">{40}</a></span> used the seal
of our prior, subscribing at the end of all letters, that he had no
seal of his own and therefore he used for the time that of the
prior.</p>

<p>Afterwards, setting his household in order, he appointed divers
servants to various duties, saying that he had decided to have
twenty-six horses in his courtyard, and that a child must first creep
and then stand upright and walk. He enjoined this to his servants
beyond all things, that they should take heed that in his new state he
be not dishonoured by a lack of meat and drink, but rather that they
in all things should anxiously provide for the hospitality of the
house. In ordering and appointing these and all other things, he fully
relied upon God's providence and his own understanding, and judged it
beneath him to require counsel at another's hand as if he were not
able to look after his own affairs.</p>

<p>The monks marvelled, the knights were discontented, accusing him of
arrogance, and, in some measure censuring him at the King's court,
saying that he refused to govern according to the advice of his own
freemen. As for him, he removed from his own private counsel the heads
of the abbey, lay as well as clerical; indeed, all those without whose
advice and assistance the abbey, as it seemed, could not be <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span> governed. By
reason of this circumstance, Ranulf de Glanville, Justiciary of
England, at first held him in distrust, and was less gracious to him
than was fitting, until it was made clear, by good evidence, that the
abbot had been acting with due caution and prudence in respect of
indoor as well as external matters.</p>

<p>A general court having been summoned, all the barons, knights and
freemen appeared to do homage on the fourth day of Easter; when,
behold, Thomas of Hastings, with a great multitude of knights, came
introducing Henry his nephew, not yet a knight, claiming the
stewardship with its perquisites, according to the tenor of his
charter. To whom the abbot replied, "I do not refuse Henry his right,
nor do I wish so to do. If he were competent to serve me in his own
person, I would assign him necessaries for ten men and eight horses in
my own court-lodge, according to the tenor of his charter. If you
present to me a steward, his deputy, who is competent and able to
perform the duty, I will receive him in the same manner as my
predecessor retained him at the time of his decease, namely, with four
horses and their appurtenances. And if this does not content you, I
shall carry the plaint before the King or his chief justice." Hereupon
the business was deferred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42" id="page_42">{42}</a></span>
Ultimately there was presented to him a simple and foolish steward,
Gilbert by name, of whom, before he received him into his household,
he spoke to his friends as follows: "If there be a default in the
administration of the King's justice through the unskilfulness of the
steward, he will be in mercy of the King, and not I, for this, that he
claims the office by hereditary right; and therefore I had much rather
receive him for the present than a sharper witted man to deceive me.
By God's assistance I trust I shall be my own steward."<br /><br /></p>

<p>After receipt of the homages, the abbot sued for an aid from the
knights, who promised each twenty shillings; but immediately they took
counsel together and withheld twelve pounds in respect of twelve
knights, alleging that those twelve ought to assist the other forty in
keeping their castle-guards, and for their escuages, as well as in
respect of the abbot's aid. The abbot, hearing this, waxed wroth, and
said to his intimate friends that if he lived long enough he would
give them turn for turn and wrong for wrong.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smcap">the new abbot's reforms</span></h2>


<p class="nodent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>FTER these things the
abbot caused inquisition to be made throughout each manor, concerning
the annual quit rents from the freemen, and the names of the labourers
and their tenements, and the services due from each; and he reduced
all into writing. Likewise he repaired those old halls and unroofed
houses round which hovered kites and crows. He built new chapels, and
likewise inner chambers and upper stories in many places where there
never had been any dwelling-house at all, but only barns. He also
enclosed many parks, which he replenished with beasts of chase,
keeping a huntsman with dogs; and, upon the visit of any person of
quality, sat with his monks in some walk of the wood, and sometimes
saw the coursing of the dogs; but I never saw him take part in the
sport.</p>

<p>He cleared much land, and brought it into tillage, in all things
looking forward to the benefit <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_44"
id="page_44">{44}</a></span> likely to accrue to the abbey; but I wish he
had been equally careful in assigning the manors of the convent.
Nevertheless, he, for a time, kept our manors of Bradfield and Rougham
in hand, making up the deficiencies of the rents by the expenditure of
forty pounds. These he afterwards reassigned to us when he heard that
dissatisfaction was expressed in the convent, on account of his
keeping our manors in his own hand. Likewise in managing these manors,
as well as in all other matters, he appointed keepers who were far
more careful than their predecessors&mdash;some monks, some laymen, to look
after us and our lands more carefully.</p>

<p>He also held the eight hundreds in his own hand, and, after the
death of Robert of Cockfield, he took in hand the hundred of Cosford,
all which he committed to the keeping of those servants who were of
his own table; referring matters of greater moment to his own
decision, and deciding by means of others upon matters of lesser
import&mdash;indeed, wringing everything to his own profit.</p>

<p>Moreover, by his command, a general survey was made throughout the
hundreds of the leets and suits, of hidages and foddercorn, of
hen-rents, and of other dues and rents and issues, which, for the
greater part, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_45"
id="page_45">{45}</a></span> had ever been concealed by the farmers. He
reduced it all to writing, so that within four years from the time of
his election, there was not one who could defraud him of the rents of
the abbey to the value of a single penny, whereas he himself had not
received from his predecessors any writing touching the management of
the abbey, except one small schedule, wherein were the names of the
knights of St. Edmund and the names of the manors, and what rent was
due on each farm. This book he called his kalendar, wherein also were
entered the debts he had satisfied; and this same book he almost daily
perused, as if in the same he were beholding the face of his honesty
in a glass.</p>

<p>The first day that he held a chapter, he confirmed to us, under his
new seal, sixty shillings from Southrey, which his predecessors had
unjustly received from Edmund, surnamed the golden monk, for the
liberty of holding the same vill to farm all the days of his life. He
also proposed, as a general rule, that from thenceforth no one should
pledge the ornaments of the church without the assent of the convent,
as had been the custom heretofore, nor that any charter should be
sealed with the convent seal, unless in chapter in the presence of the
convent. He appointed <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46"
id="page_46">{46}</a></span> Hugh as sub-sacrist, ordering that William
the sacrist should not have anything to do with the sacristy, either
in the matter of receipt or disbursement, unless by his consent. After
this, but not on the same day, he transferred the former keepers of
the offerings to other offices; lastly, he deposed the same William:
wherefore those who liked William said, "Behold the abbot! Lo, here is
the wolf of whom it was dreamed! See how he rages!"</p>

<p>And some of them would have entered into a conspiracy against the
abbot. When this was disclosed to him, he, not caring to be altogether
silent, nor yet to disquiet the convent, entered the chapter-house on
the morrow, and pulled out a little bag full of cancelled deeds, the
seals yet hanging thereto, consisting of the securities, partly of his
predecessor, partly of the prior, partly of the sacrist, partly of the
chamberlain, and other officials, whereof the total was three thousand
and fifty-two pounds and one mark without alloy, besides the interest
that had accrued thereupon, the amount of which could never be
ascertained. All these he had arranged for within one year after his
election, and within twelve years entirely discharged. "Behold," said
he, "the good management of William, our sacrist; look at the
multitude <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47"
id="page_47">{47}</a></span> of securities signed with his seal, whereby
he has pledged silken copes, dalmatics, censers of silver and books
ornamented with gold, without the knowledge of the convent, all which
I have redeemed and have restored to you."</p>

<p>He likewise added many other things, showing why he had deposed the
said William: howbeit he suppressed the real cause, not wishing to put
him to open shame. And when he put Samson the precentor in his place,
a person approved by us, and above all objection, everything was quiet
again. Furthermore, the abbot commanded that the houses of the sacrist
in the cemetery should be entirely plucked up, as though they were not
worthy to stand upon the earth, by reason of the frequent
wine-bibbings, and certain other acts not to be named, which he, with
grief and indignation, had witnessed while he was sub-sacrist. So
completely did he obliterate the whole that, within a year, upon the
spot where a noble dwelling had stood, we saw beans growing, and where
casks of wine had lain, nettles abounding.</p>

<p>After the end of Easter, the abbot went over every one of his and
our manors, as well as over those we had confirmed to the farmers in
fee, requiring from all of them aid and acknowledgment, according to
the law of the land. Thus every day he was increasing <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span> in secular
knowledge, and was turning his attention to the learning and method of
ordering outdoor affairs. Now when he had come to Warkton, where he
slept at night, there came to him a voice saying, "Samson, arise up
quickly"; and, again, "Get up without delay." Getting up astonished,
he looked around him, and perceived a light in a necessary house,
namely, a candle ready to fall down upon the straw, which Reiner the
monk had carelessly left there. When the abbot had put it out, going
through the house, he perceived the door (which was the sole entrance)
so fastened that it could only be opened by a key&mdash;likewise the
windows fastened: so that if a fire had arisen, he, and all with him,
who slept upon that floor, had surely perished, for there was no place
whence they might get out or escape.</p>

<p>At that time, wheresoever the abbot went, there came about him Jews
as well as Christians, demanding debts, and worrying and importuning
him so that he could not sleep. Thereupon he became pale and thin, and
was constantly repeating, "My heart will never rest until I know the
extent of my debts." The feast of St. Michael being come, he took all
his manors into his own hand, with but small store of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">{49}</a></span> live or dead
stock; he freely forgave Walter of Hatfield nineteen pounds arrears,
that he might absolutely take back four manors which Hugh the abbot
had confirmed to him, namely, Hargrave and Saxham and Chevington and
Stapleford; Harlow, indeed, the abbot deferred to take to himself on
the present occasion.</p>

<p>Once on a time, as we passed through the forest in returning from
London, I inquired in the hearing of my lord abbot, from an old woman
passing by, whose was this wood, and of what town, who was the lord,
and who was the keeper? She answered that the wood belonged to the
abbot of St. Edmund, as part of the town of Harlow, and that the name
of the keeper was Arnald. When I inquired further, how Arnald
conducted himself towards the men of the town, she answered, that he
was a devil incarnate, an enemy of God, and one to flay the poor
alive; but now, she added, he is afraid of the new abbot of St.
Edmund, whom he believes to be prudent and vigilant, and therefore he
treats the men gently. On hearing this, the abbot was delighted, and
deferred taking to the manor for a season.</p>

<p>At that time there came unexpectedly the news of the death of the
wife of Herlewin of Rungton, who <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50"
id="page_50">{50}</a></span> had a charter to hold the same town for her
life; and the abbot said, "Yesterday, I would have given sixty marks
to have freed the manor from this incumbrance, but now God has freed
it." And as he was going thither without delay, that he might take
that town into his own hand, and on the morrow was going to Tillener,
a part of that manor, there came a certain knight offering thirty
marks for the tenure of that carucate of land, with the appurtenances,
by the old rent-service, to wit, four pounds, whereto the abbot could
not agree; and he had therefrom in that year twenty-five pounds, and
the second year twenty pounds.</p>

<p>These and such like things induced him to hold everything in his
own keeping; as it is written elsewhere, "Cæsar was all in all." In
the first place, far from being inert, he commenced building barns and
byres, above all things solicitous to dress the land for tillage, and
watchful in preserving the woods, in respect whereof, either in giving
or diminishing, he confessed himself to be a very miser. There was but
one manor, and that was Thorpe, which by his charter he confirmed to
one of English birth, a villein, whose honesty he trusted the more, as
he was a good husbandman, and could not speak French.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">{51}</a></span>
Scarcely seven months had elapsed since his election, when, behold!
there were presented to him the letters of our lord the Pope,
appointing him a judge to determine causes, for the execution of which
he was incompetent and inexperienced, although he was thoroughly
imbued with liberal arts and divinity, as befitted a man of learning,
a literate man, educated in the schools and a master in them, known
and approved in his own province. Wherefore he invited two clerks,
learned in the law, and associated them to himself. Of their advice he
availed himself in ecclesiastical matters, employing himself upon the
decrees and decretal epistles, when an opportunity offered; so that
within a short time, as well by references to books as by the handling
of causes, he became reputed a discreet judge, proceeding in every
suit according to form of law; so a certain person said, "Cursed be
the court of this abbot, where neither gold nor silver can help me to
confound my adversary."</p>

<p>In process of time, becoming somewhat practised in secular causes,
and taught by an inborn commonsense, he became of so subtle a wit that
all marvelled; indeed, by Osbert Fitz-Hervey, the under-sheriff, it
was said, "This abbot is a wrangler; if he goes on <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_52" id="page_52">{52}</a></span> as he has
begun, he will outwit us all, many as we be." Now the abbot becoming
an expert man in causes of this description, was made a justice
errant, but yet he preserved himself from error and corruption. But
"envy aims at the highest." When his men made their plaints to him in
the court of St. Edmund, because he was unwilling to give hasty
judgment, or to "believe every spirit," but preferred to proceed in
due course of law, well knowing that the merits of causes are
developed by the allegations of the parties, it was said of him that
he would not do justice to any complainant, unless by the intervention
of money given or promised.</p>

<p>Because his aspect was acute and penetrating, with a Cato-like
countenance, rarely smiling, it was said that he inclined to severity
rather than kindness. In receiving amerciaments for any forfeiture, it
was said that "Mercy rejoices against judgment"; for as it seemed to
many, when it became an affair of receiving money, he seldom remitted
what by law he was entitled to take.</p>

<p>In like manner as he advanced in wisdom, so did he advance in
thoughtful care, in respect of keeping and acquiring property, and in
creditably regulating his expenses. But even here many backbiters took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_53" id="page_53">{53}</a></span> their
ground, saying that he resorted to the sacristy at his own pleasure,
sparing his own purse, letting his corn lie by for a dear season, and
taking to his manors in other sort than his predecessors did, charging
the cellarer with the entertainment of those guests he himself was
bound to receive; so that by this craft it might be said that the
abbot was careful and well stocked at the end of the year; while, on
the other hand, the convent and officials were to be accounted
careless and improvident. In reply to these back-bitings, I used to
observe, that if he took anything from the sacrist, he turned it to
the good account of the church, and this none of these slanderers
could deny. And in good truth, greater and more numerous works were
carried out by the help of the offerings to the sacristy within
fifteen years after his election than in the forty years before
it.</p>

<p>To the other objections, that the abbot was fond of betaking
himself to his manors, I was wont to answer, and did excuse him,
saying, "The reason is because the abbot is more in spirits and in
good humour elsewhere than at home." And this was true enough, whether
it were by reason of the frequency of suitors who came about him, or
from the tale-bearers, wherefore it frequently happened that <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_54" id="page_54">{54}</a></span> by the
appearance of severity in his face he lost much favour and grace in
the eyes of his guests, notwithstanding they fared well in eating and
drinking. I noticed this, and took an opportunity, when I was with him
in private, to say, "There are two things in which I am much surprised
at you." When he had inquired what these things might be, "One is that
in spite of your position you still encourage the doctrine of the
school of Melun, which says that from a false premiss no conclusion
can follow, and other idle sayings."</p>

<p>To which, when he had said his say, I added, "The other indeed is,
that when you are at home you do not exhibit the same gracious
demeanour you do when elsewhere, nor do you mix in society with those
brethren who have a strong regard for you, and have chosen you for
their lord; but contrariwise, you seldom associate with them, nor do
you, as they say, make yourself on sociable terms with them." Hearing
this, he changed countenance, and hanging down his head, said, "You
are a simpleton, and speak foolishly; you ought to know what Solomon
says&mdash;'Hast thou many daughters: show not thyself cheerful toward
them.'" I indeed held my peace from thenceforth, setting a watch on my
mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_55" id="page_55">{55}</a></span> On
another occasion I said, "My lord, I heard you this night after matins
wakeful and sighing heavily, contrary to your usual wont." He
answered, "No wonder; you are partaker of my good things, in meat and
drink, in riding abroad, and such like, but you have little need to
care concerning the conduct of the house and household of the saints,
and arduous business of the pastoral care which harasses me and makes
my spirit to groan and be heavy." Whereto I, lifting up my hands to
heaven, made answer, "From such anxiety, almighty and most merciful
Lord, deliver me!"</p>

<p>I have heard the abbot say, that if he could have been as he was
before he became a monk, and could have had five or six marks of
income wherewith he could have been supported in the schools, he never
would have been monk or abbot. On another occasion he said with an
oath, that if he could have foreseen what and how great a charge it
had been to govern the abbey, he would rather than abbot and lord have
been master of the almonry, and keeper of the books, for this office
he said he had ever desired above all others. Yet who would credit
this? Scarcely myself; and not even myself, except that being
constantly with him by day and night for <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_56" id="page_56">{56}</a></span> six years, I had had the
opportunity of becoming fully conversant with the worthiness of his
life and the wisdom of his rule.</p>

<p>He once related to me, that when he was a child of nine years old,
he dreamed that he was standing before the gates of the cemetery of
the church of St. Edmund, and that the devil, with outspread arms,
would have seized him, had not St. Edmund, standing by, taken him in
his arms; whereupon he screamed whilst dreaming in his sleep, "St.
Edmund, save me!" and thus calling upon him whose name he had never
heard, he awoke. His mother was alarmed at such an outcry, but having
heard the dream, took him to St. Edmund for the purpose of praying
there; and when they had come to the gate of the cemetery he said,
"See, mother, this is the place, this is the very same gate which I
saw in my dream when the devil was about to seize me"; and he knew the
place as well, to use his own words, as if he had seen it before with
his natural eyes. The abbot himself interpreted this dream thus: By
the devil were signified the pleasures of this mortal state, which
would fain have drawn him away; but St. Edmund threw his arms around
him when he made him a monk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57">{57}</a></span> Once
when he was told that certain of the convent grumbled at some act of
his, he said to me as I sat by him, "Good God! there is need enough
that I should remember that dream wherein it was dreamed of me, before
I was made abbot, that I was to rage among them as a wolf. True it is
that above all earthly things I dread lest the convent behave in such
a way that I shall be compelled so to rage. But even so it is, when
they say or do anything against my will, I bring to mind that dream of
theirs, and although I do rage in my own soul, growling and gnashing
my teeth in secret, I do violence to myself lest I should actually
rage in word or deed," and "My hidden grief chokes me and my heart
surges within me."</p>

<p>Although by nature he was quick to wrath, and easily kindled to
anger, yet with a great struggle he mostly restrained his temper in
view of the dignity he held. Concerning which he sometimes used to
boast, "This and that I saw, this and that I heard, yet I held my
peace." The abbot once said, seated in chapter, certain words by which
he seemed to eagerly desire the good-will of the monastery. "I do not
wish," he said, "that any one should come to me to accuse another,
unless he is willing to say the same openly. If any one does
otherwise, I will publicly <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58"
id="page_58">{58}</a></span> proclaim the name of the accuser. I wish also
that every cloister monk shall have free access to me, that he may
speak to me, whenever he chooses, concerning all things necessary to
him." This he said, because our leaders in the days of Abbot Hugh,
wishing that nothing should be done in the monastery except through
them, had decreed that no cloister monk should speak with the abbot
unless he had first told the abbot's chaplain what he wished to speak
about.</p>

<p>On a certain day he made an order in chapter, that every one who
had a seal of his own should give it up to him, and so it was
accordingly done, and there were found three-and-thirty seals. He
himself explained the reason of this order, forbidding that any
official should incur any debt above twenty shillings without the
assent of the prior and convent, as had been the custom heretofore. To
the prior and to the sacrist, indeed, he returned their seals, but
kept the rest himself.</p>

<p>At another time he ordered to be delivered up to him all the keys
of the chests, cupboards, and hanapers, strictly enjoining that
thenceforth none presume to have a chest or anything locked up, unless
by special permission, or otherwise possess anything beyond what the
rule allows. Notwithstanding <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_59"
id="page_59">{59}</a></span> this he gave general licence to every one of
us to have money to the amount of two shillings, if so much happened
to have been given to us by way of charity; so that it might be
expended upon poor relations, or for purposes of piety.</p>

<p>On another occasion the abbot said, that he was desirous of
adhering to our ancient custom respecting the entertainment of guests;
that is, when the abbot is at home, he is to receive all guests of
whatsoever condition they may be, except religious and priests of
secular habit, and except their men who present themselves at the gate
of the court in the name of their masters; but if the abbot be not at
home, then all guests of whatsoever condition are to be received by
the cellarer up to thirteen horses. But if a layman or clerk shall
come with more than thirteen horses, they shall be entertained by the
servants of the abbot, either within the court-lodge, or without, at
the expense of the abbot. All religious men, even bishops if they
happen to be monks, are to be charged upon the cellary and at the
expense of the convent, unless the abbot will do any one special
honour, and entertain him in his own hall at his own expense.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smcap">samson's personal characteristics</span></h2>


<p class="nodent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE abbot Samson was of
middle stature, nearly bald, having a face neither round nor yet long,
a prominent nose, thick lips, clear and very piercing eyes, ears of
the nicest sense of hearing, arched eyebrows, often shaved; and he
soon became hoarse from a short exposure to cold. On the day of his
election he was forty and seven years old, and had been a monk
seventeen years. He had then a few grey hairs in a reddish beard, and
a very few in a black and somewhat curly head of hair. But within
fourteen years after his election it became as white as snow.</p>

<p>He was a man remarkably temperate, never slothful, of strong
constitution, and willing to ride or walk till old age gained upon him
and moderated such inclination. On hearing the news of the Cross being
taken, and the loss of Jerusalem, he began to use under garments <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61">{61}</a></span> of horsehair
and a horsehair shirt, and to abstain from flesh and flesh meats.
Nevertheless, he desired that meats should be placed before him at
table for the increase of the alms dish. Sweet milk, honey and such
like sweet things he ate with greater appetite than other food.</p>

<p>He abhorred liars, drunkards and talkative folk; for virtue ever is
consistent with itself and rejects contraries. He also much condemned
persons given to murmur at their meat or drink, and particularly monks
who were dissatisfied therewith, himself adhering to the uniform
course he had practised when a monk. He had likewise this virtue in
himself, that he never changed the mess set before him.</p>

<p>Once when I, then a novice, happened to be serving in the
refectory, I wished to prove if this were true, and I thought I would
place before him a mess which would have displeased any other than
him, in a very black and broken dish. But when he looked at it, he was
as one that saw it not. Some delay took place, and I felt sorry that I
had so done; and snatching away the dish, I changed the mess and the
dish for a better, and brought it to him; but this substitution he
took in ill part, and was angry with me for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62">{62}</a></span> An
eloquent man was he, both in French and Latin, but intent more on the
substance and method of what was to be said than on the style of
words. He could read English books most admirably, and was wont to
preach to the people in English, but in the dialect of Norfolk, where
he was born and bred; and so he caused a pulpit to be set up in the
church for the ease of the hearers, and for the ornament of the
church. The abbot also seemed to prefer an active life to one of
contemplation, and rather commended good officials than good monks. He
very seldom approved of any one on account of his literary
acquirements, unless he also possessed sufficient knowledge of secular
matters; and whenever he chanced to hear that any prelate had resigned
his pastoral care and become an anchorite, he did not praise him for
it. He never applauded men of too compliant a disposition, saying, "He
who endeavours to please all, ought to please none."</p>

<p>In the first year of his being abbot, he appeared to hate all
flatterers, and especially among the monks; but in process of time it
seemed that he heard them more readily, and was more familiar with
them. It once happened that a certain brother of ours, skilled in this
art, had bent the knee before him, and under <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_63" id="page_63">{63}</a></span> the pretence of giving advice,
had poured the oil of flattery into his ears. I, standing apart,
smiled. The brother having departed, I was called and asked why I had
smiled. I answered, "The world is full of flatterers." And the abbot
replied, "My son, it is long that I have known flatterers; I cannot,
therefore, avoid hearing them. There are many things to be passed over
and taken no notice of, if the peace of the convent is to be
preserved. I will hear what they have to say, but they shall not
deceive me if I can help it, as they did my predecessor, who trusted
so unadvisedly to their counsel that for a long time before his death
he had nothing for himself or his household to eat, unless it were
obtained on trust from creditors; nor was there anything to be
distributed among the poor on the day of his burial, unless it were
the fifty shillings which were received from Richard the farmer, of
Palgrave, which very fifty shillings the same Richard on another
occasion had to pay to the King's bailiffs, who demanded the entire
farm-rent for the King's use." With this saying I was comforted. His
study, indeed, was to have a well-regulated house, and enough
wherewith to keep his household, so managing that the usual allowance
for a week, which his predecessor could not <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_64" id="page_64">{64}</a></span> make last for five days,
sufficed him for eight, nine or even ten days, if so be that he was at
his manors without any extraordinary arrival of guests. Every week,
indeed, he audited the expenses of the house, not by deputy, but in
his own person, which his predecessor had never been wont to do.</p>

<p>For the first seven years he had only four courses in his house,
afterwards only three, except presents and game from his parks, or
fish from his ponds. And if at any time he retained any one in his
house at the request of a great man, or of a particular friend, or
messengers, or minstrels, or any person of that description, by taking
the opportunity of going beyond sea or travelling afar off, he
prudently disencumbered himself of such hangers-on.</p>

<p>The monks with whom the abbot had been the most intimate, and whom
he liked best before he became abbot, he seldom promoted to offices
merely for old acquaintance' sake, unless they were fit persons.
Wherefore certain of our brethren who had been favourable to his
election as abbot, said that he cared less for those who had liked him
before he became abbot than was proper, and particularly that those
were most favoured by him who both openly and in secret had spoken
evil of him, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65"
id="page_65">{65}</a></span> nay, had even publicly called him, in the
hearing of many, a passionate unsociable man, a proud fellow, and
Norfolk barrator. But on the other hand, as after he had received the
abbacy he exhibited no indiscreet partiality for his old friends, so
he refrained from showing anything like hatred or dislike to many
others according to their deserts, returning frequently good for evil,
and doing good to them that persecuted him.</p>

<p>He had this way also, which I have never observed in any other man,
that he had an affectionate regard for many to whom he seldom or never
showed a countenance of love; according to the common proverb which
says, "Where love is, there is the regard of love." And another thing
I wondered at in him was, that he knowingly suffered loss in his
temporal matters from his own servants, and confessed that he winked
at them; but this I believe to have been the reason, that he might
watch a convenient opportunity when the matter could be advisedly
remedied, or that by passing over these matters without notice, he
might avoid a greater loss.</p>

<p>He loved his kinsmen indifferently, but not less tenderly than
others, for he had not, or assumed not to have, any relative within
the third degree. I <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_66"
id="page_66">{66}</a></span> have heard him state that he had relations
who were noble and gentle, whom he never would in any wise recognize
as relations; for, as he said, they would be more a burden than an
honour to him, if they should happen to find out their relationship.
But he always acknowledged those as kinsmen who had treated him as
such when he was a poor monk. Some of these relations (that is, those
whom he found useful and suitable) he appointed to various offices in
his own house, others he made keepers of manors. But those whom he
found unworthy, he irrevocably dismissed from his presence.</p>

<p>A certain man of lowly station, who had managed his patrimony
faithfully, and had served him devotedly in his youth, he looked upon
as his dearest kinsman, and gave to his son, who was a clerk, the
first church that fell vacant after he came to the charge of the
abbey, and also advanced all the other sons of this man.</p>

<p>He invited to him a certain chaplain who had maintained him in the
schools of Paris by the sale of holy water, and bestowed upon him an
ecclesiastical benefice sufficient for his maintenance by way of
vicarage. He granted to a certain servant of his predecessor food and
clothing all the days of his life, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_67" id="page_67">{67}</a></span> he being the very man who put
the fetters upon him at his lord's command when he was cast into
prison. To the son of Elias, the cupbearer of Hugh the abbot, when he
came to do homage for his father's land, he said, in full court, "I
have for these seven years deferred taking your homage for the land
which the abbot Hugh gave your father, because that gift was to the
damage of the manor of Elmswell. Now I am overcome when I call to my
mind what your father did for me when I was in fetters, for he sent to
me a portion of the very wine whereof his lord had been drinking, and
bade me be strong in God." To Master Walter, the son of Master William
of Diss, suing at his grace for the vicarage of the church of
Chevington, he replied, "Your father was master of the schools, and at
the time when I was a poor clerk he granted me freely and in charity
an entrance to his school, and the means of learning; now I, for the
sake of God, do grant you what you ask."</p>

<p>He addressed two knights of Risby, William and Norman, at the time
when they were adjudged to be in his mercy, publicly in this wise:
"When I was a cloister monk, sent to Durham upon business of our
church, and thence returning through Risby, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_68" id="page_68">{68}</a></span> being benighted, I sought a
night's lodging from Norman, and I received a blank refusal; but going
to the house of William, and seeking shelter, I was honourably
entertained by him. Now, therefore, those twenty shillings, which are
'the mercy,' I will without mercy exact from Norman; but contrariwise,
to William I give thanks, and the amerciament of twenty shillings that
is due from him I do with pleasure remit."</p>

<p>A certain young girl, seeking her food from door to door,
complained to the abbot that one of the sons of Richard, the son of
Drogo, had forced her; and at length, by the suggestion of the abbot,
for the sake of peace, she took one mark in satisfaction. The abbot,
moreover, took from the same Richard four marks for licence to agree;
but all those five marks he ordered forthwith to be given to a certain
chapman, upon the condition that he should take this poor woman to
wife.</p>

<p>In the town of St. Edmund, the abbot purchased stone houses, and
assigned them for the use of the schools, so that thereby the poor
clerks should be for ever free from house-rent, towards payment
whereof all the scholars, whether rich or poor, were compelled <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69">{69}</a></span> twice in the
year to subscribe a penny or a halfpenny.</p>

<p>The recovery of the manor of Mildenhall for one thousand and one
hundred marks of silver, and the expulsion of the Jews from the town
of St. Edmund, and the founding of the new hospital at Babwell, are
proofs of great virtue.</p>

<p>The lord abbot sought from the King letters enjoining that the Jews
should be driven away from the town of St. Edmund, he stating that
whatsoever is within the town of St. Edmund, or within the banlieue
thereof, of right belongs to St. Edmund: therefore the Jews ought to
become the men of St. Edmund, otherwise they should be expelled from
the town. Licence was accordingly given that he might put them forth,
saving, nevertheless, that they had all their chattels and the value
of their houses and lands. And when they were expelled, and with an
armed force conducted to divers towns, the abbot gave order that all
those that from henceforth should harbour or entertain Jews in the
town of St. Edmund should be solemnly excommunicated in every church
and at every altar. Howbeit it was afterwards conceded by the King's
justices that if the Jews should come to the great pleas of the abbot
to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70">{70}</a></span>
demand their debts from their debtors, on such occasion they might for
two days and two nights lodge within the town, and on the third day be
permitted to depart freely.</p>

<p>The abbot offered King Richard five hundred marks for the manor of
Mildenhall, stating that the manor was worthy sixty and ten pounds by
the year, and for so much had been recorded in the great roll of
Winchester. And when he had conceived hopes of success in his
application, the matter rested till the morrow. In the meanwhile there
came a certain person to the King, telling him that this manor was
well worth yearly a hundred pounds. On the morrow, therefore, when the
abbot urged his suit, the King said, "It is of no avail my lord abbot,
what you ask me; you shall either give a thousand marks, or you shall
not have the manor." And whereas the Queen Eleanor, according to the
custom of the realm, ought to have one hundred marks where the King
receives a thousand, she took of us a great gold cup of the value of a
hundred marks, and gave us back the same cup for the soul of her lord,
King Henry, who first gave the same cup to St. Edmund. On another
occasion, when the treasure of our <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_71" id="page_71">{71}</a></span> church was carried to London
for the ransom of King Richard, the same Queen redeemed that cup for
one hundred marks, and restored it to us, taking in return our charter
from us as an evidence of our most solemn promise, that we should
never again alienate that cup from our church upon any occasion
whatever.</p>

<p>Now, when all this money, which was got together with great
difficulty, had been paid, the abbot held a chapter, and said he ought
to have some portion of the great advantage derivable from so valuable
a manor. And the convent answered that it was just, and "Let it be
according to your wish." The abbot replied that he could well claim
the half part as his own right, demonstrating that he had paid towards
this purchase more than four hundred marks, with much inconvenience to
himself. But he said that he would be content with a certain allotment
of that manor called Icklingham, which was most freely granted him by
the convent. When the abbot heard this, he said, "And I do accept this
part of the land to my own use, but not that I intend to keep the same
in my own hand, or that I shall give it to my relations, but for the
good of my soul and for all your souls in common, I <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">{72}</a></span> give the same
to the new hospital at Babwell, for the relief of the poor, and the
maintenance of hospitality." As he said, so it was done, and
afterwards confirmed by the King's Charter.</p>

<p>These and all other like things worthy to be written down and
lauded for ever did the abbot Samson. But he said he had done nothing,
unless he could have our church dedicated in his lifetime; which done,
he said he wished to die. For the solemnization of this act, he said
he was ready to pay two thousand marks of silver, so that the King
should be present, and the affair be completed with the reverence it
demanded.</p>

<p>The abbot was informed that the church of Woolpit was vacant,
Walter of Coutances being chosen to the bishopric of Lincoln. He
presently convened the prior and great part of the convent, and taking
up his story thus began: "You well know what trouble I had in respect
of the church of Woolpit; and in order that it should be obtained for
your exclusive use I journeyed to Rome at your instance, in the time
of the schism between Pope Alexander and Octavian. I passed through
Italy at that time when all clerks bearing letters of our lord the
Pope Alexander were taken. Some were imprisoned, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_73" id="page_73">{73}</a></span> some hanged, and some, with
nose and lips cut off, sent forward to the pope, to his shame and
confusion. I, however, pretended to be Scotch; and putting on the garb
of a Scotchman, and the gesture of one, I often brandished my staff,
in the way they use that weapon called a gaveloc, at those who mocked
me, using threatening language, after the manner of the Scotch. To
those that met and questioned me as to who I was, I answered nothing,
but, 'Ride ride Rome, turne Cantwereberei.' This did I to conceal
myself and my errand, and that I should get to Rome safer in the guise
of a Scotchman.</p>

<p>"Having obtained letters from the pope, even as I wished, on my
return I passed by a certain castle, as my way led me from the city;
and behold the officers thereof came about me, laying hold upon me,
and saying, 'This vagabond who makes himself out to be a Scotchman is
either a spy or bears letters from the false pope Alexander.' And
while they examined my ragged clothes, and my boots, and my breeches,
and even the old shoes which I carried over my shoulders, after the
fashion of the Scotch, I thrust my hand into the little wallet which I
carried, wherein was contained the letter of our lord the pope, placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_74" id="page_74">{74}</a></span> under a
little cup I had for drinking. The Lord God and St. Edmund so
permitting, I drew out both the letter and the cup together, so that
extending my arm aloft, I held the letter underneath the cup. They
could see the cup plain enough, but they did not see the letter; and
so I got clear out of their hands, in the name of the Lord. Whatever
money I had about me they took away; therefore I had to beg from door
to door, without any payment, until I arrived in England.</p>

<p>"But hearing that this church had been given to Geoffrey Ridel, my
soul was heavy, because I had laboured in vain. Coming, therefore,
home, I crept under the shrine of St. Edmund, fearing lest the abbot
should seize and imprison me, although I deserved no punishment; nor
was there a monk who durst speak to me, or a layman who durst bring me
food except by stealth. At last, upon consideration, the abbot sent me
to Acre in exile, and there I remained a long time.</p>

<p>"These and innumerable other things have I endured on account of
this church of Woolpit, but, blessed be God, who works all things
together, behold! this very church, for which I have borne so many
sufferings is given into my hand, and now I have the power of <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_75" id="page_75">{75}</a></span> presenting it
to whomsoever I will, because it is vacant. And now I restore it to
the convent, and I assign to its exclusive use, the ancient custom or
pension of ten marks, which you have lost for upwards of sixty years.
I had much rather have given it to you entire, could I have done so;
but I know that the Bishop of Norwich might gainsay this; or even if
he did grant it, he would make it an occasion to claim to himself such
subjection and obedience from you as it is not advisable or expedient
you should acknowledge. Therefore let us do that which by law we may;
that is, put a clerk in as vicar, who shall account to the bishop for
the spiritualities, and to yourselves for ten marks. I propose, if you
all agree, that this vicarage be given to some kinsman of Roger de
Hengham, a monk, and one of your brethren who was joined with me in
that expedition to Rome, and was exposed to the same perils as myself,
and in respect of the very same matter."<br /><br /></p>

<p>This said, we all rose and gave thanks; and Hugh, a clerk, brother
of the said Roger, was nominated to the aforesaid church, saving to us
our pension of ten marks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_76" id="page_76">{76}</a></span><br /></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smcap">the abbot as peer of parliament</span></h2>


<p class="nodent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>N that manor of the
monks of Canterbury which is called Eleigh, and is within the hundred
of the abbot, a case of homicide occurred; but the men of the
archbishop would not permit that those manslayers should stand their
trial in the court of St. Edmund. Thereupon the abbot made his plaint
to King Henry, stating that Baldwin the archbishop was claiming for
himself the liberties of our church, under authority of a new charter,
which the King had given to the church of Canterbury after the death
of St. Thomas. The King hereupon made answer, that he had never made
any grant in derogation of the rights of our church, nor did he wish
to take away from St. Edmund anything that had ever belonged to
him.</p>

<p>On this intelligence, the abbot said to his most intimate advisers,
"It is the better counsel that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_77"
id="page_77">{77}</a></span> the archbishop should have to complain of me
than I of the archbishop. I will put myself in seisin of this liberty,
and afterwards will defend myself thereupon by the help of St. Edmund,
whose right our charters testify it to be." Therefore suddenly and at
daybreak, by the assistance of Robert of Cockfield, there were
dispatched about fourscore men to the town of Eleigh, who took by
surprise those three manslayers, and led them bound to St. Edmund, and
cast them into the body of the gaol there.</p>

<p>Now, the archbishop complaining of this, Ranulf de Glanville, the
justiciary, commanded that those men be put by gage and pledges to
stand their trial in that court wherein they ought to stand trial; and
the abbot was summoned to come before the King's court to answer
touching the violence and injury which he was said to have done to the
archbishop. The abbot thereupon offered himself several times without
any essoin.</p>

<p>At length, upon Ash Wednesday, they stood before the King in the
chapter house of Canterbury, and the charters of the King on one side
and the other were read in court. And our lord the King said: "These
charters are of the same age, and emanate <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_78" id="page_78">{78}</a></span> from the same King, Edward. I
know not what I can say, unless it be that these charters contradict
each other." To whom the abbot said: "Whatever observations may apply
to the charters, we are seised, and hitherto have been; and of this I
am willing to put myself upon the verdict of the two counties of
Norfolk and Suffolk, if they do allow this to be the case."</p>

<p>But Archbishop Baldwin, having first conferred with his advisers,
said that the men of Norfolk and Suffolk greatly loved St. Edmund, and
that great part of those counties was under the control of the abbot,
and therefore he was unwilling to stand by their decision. The King at
this waxed wroth, and in indignation got up, and in departing said,
"He that is able to receive it, let him receive it." And so the matter
was put off, and the case is yet undecided.</p>

<p>However, I observed that some of the men of the monks of Canterbury
were wounded even to death by the country folk of the town of Milden,
which is situate in the hundred of St. Edmund; and because they knew
that the prosecutor ought to make suit to the jurisdiction wherein the
culprit is, they chose to be silent and to put up with it, rather than
make complaint thereupon to the abbot or his bailiffs, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_79" id="page_79">{79}</a></span> because in no
wise would they come into the court of St. Edmund to plead there.</p>

<p>After this the men of Eleigh set up a certain cucking-stool,
whereat justice was to be done in respect of deceits in the measuring
of bread or corn; whereof the abbot complained to the Lord Bishop of
Ely, then justiciary and chancellor. But he was anything but desirous
to hear the abbot, because it was said that he was smelling after the
archbishopric, which at that time was vacant. Some time afterwards,
when he had come on a visitation, being entertained as legate, before
he departed he made a speech at the shrine of the holy martyr. The
abbot, seizing the opportunity, said to all present, "My lord bishop,
the liberty which the monks of Canterbury claim for themselves is the
right of St. Edmund, whose body is here present; and because you do
not choose to render me assistance to protect the privileges of his
church, I place that plaint between him and you. Let him from
henceforth get justice done to himself." The chancellor deigned not to
answer a single word; but within a year from that time was driven from
England, and experienced divine vengeance.</p>

<p>Now when the same chancellor, on his return <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_80" id="page_80">{80}</a></span> from Germany, had arrived at
Ipswich, and rested the night at Hitcham, news was brought that he
wished to take St. Edmund in his way, and would hear mass with us on
the morrow. The abbot, therefore, gave strict injunctions that the
offices of the church should not be celebrated so long as the
chancellor was present in the church; for he said he had heard at
London that the Bishop of London had pronounced in the presence of six
bishops that the Chancellor was excommunicate, and had left England
excommunicate, particularly for the violence he committed upon the
Archbishop of York at Dover.</p>

<p>Therefore when the chancellor came to us on the morrow, he found no
one, neither clerk nor monk, who would sing a mass. Indeed, not only
the priest standing at the first mass, and beginning the canon of the
mass, but the other priests standing before the altars, ceased,
remaining with unmoved lips until a messenger came, saying that he had
departed from the church. The chancellor put up with it at the time,
but did many injuries to the abbot, until at length, by the
intervention of friends, both parties returned to the kiss of
peace.</p>

<p>When King Henry had taken the Cross, and had come to us within a
month afterwards to pay his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81"
id="page_81">{81}</a></span> devotions, the abbot privily made for himself
a cross of linen cloth, and holding in one hand the cross and a needle
and thread, he requested licence from the King to take upon himself
the cross. But this privilege was denied him, upon the suggestion of
John, Bishop of Norwich, who said that it was not expedient for the
country, or indeed safe for the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, that
the Bishop of Norwich and the Abbot of St. Edmund should be both away
at the same time.</p>

<p>When the news came to London of the capture of King Richard and his
imprisonment in Germany, and the barons met to take counsel thereupon,
the abbot started up before them all, saying that he was quite ready
to seek his lord the King, either in disguise or any other way, until
he had discovered where he was, and had gained certain intelligence of
him; by reason whereof he obtained great approbation.</p>

<p>When the chancellor, the Bishop of Ely, filled the office of
legate, and in that capacity was holding a council at London, he
proposed certain decrees against the black monks, taking notice of
their wandering to St. Thomas and St. Edmund, on the excuse of
pilgrimage, and inveighed against abbots, restricting them in the
number of their horses. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82"
id="page_82">{82}</a></span> Abbot Samson replied, "We do not admit any
decree against that rule of St. Benedict which allows the abbots the
free and absolute government of their monks. I keep the barony of St.
Edmund and his kingdom; nor are thirteen horses sufficient for me as
they may be for some abbots, unless I have more to enable me to
execute the King's justice."</p>

<p>Whilst there was war throughout England, during the captivity of
King Richard, the abbot, with his whole convent, solemnly
excommunicated all movers of the war and disturbers of the public
peace, not fearing the Earl John, the King's brother, nor any other,
so that he was styled the "stout-hearted abbot." After this he went to
the siege of Windsor, where he appeared in armour with certain other
abbots of England, having his own standard, and retaining many knights
at heavy charges, being more remarkable there for his counsel than for
his piety. But we cloister folk thought this act rather perilous,
fearing lest in consequence some future abbot might be compelled to
attend in person upon any warlike expedition. On the conclusion of a
truce he went into Germany, and there visited the King with many
gifts.</p>

<p>After the return of King Richard to England, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_83" id="page_83">{83}</a></span> licence was granted for
holding tournaments; for which purpose many knights met between
Thetford and St. Edmund. The abbot forbade them; but they, resisting,
fulfilled their desire. On another occasion there came twenty-four
young men with their followers, sons of noblemen, to have their
revenge at the aforesaid place; which being done, they returned into
the town to put up there. The abbot hearing of this, ordered the gates
to be locked, and all of them to be kept within. The next day was the
vigil of Peter and Paul the apostles. Therefore, having passed their
word and promising that they would not go forth without permission,
they all dined with the abbot on that day. After dinner, when the
abbot retired to his chamber, they all arose and began to carol and
sing, sending into the town for wine, drinking and then shouting,
depriving the abbot and convent of their sleep, and doing everything
in scorn of the abbot. They spent the day until the evening in this
manner; and refused to desist, even when the abbot commanded them. But
when evening was come, they broke open the gates of the town and went
forth by force. The abbot, indeed, solemnly excommunicated all of
them, yet not without first consulting Archbishop Hubert, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_84" id="page_84">{84}</a></span> at that time
justiciary; and many of them came, promising amendment and seeking
absolution.</p>

<p>The abbot often sent his messengers to Rome, by no means
empty-handed. The first he sent, immediately after he was consecrated,
obtained in general terms all the liberties and privileges which had
been granted of yore to his predecessors, even in the time of the
schism. Next he obtained, first among the abbots of England, that he
might be able to give episcopal benediction solemnly, wheresoever he
might happen to be, and this he obtained for himself and for his
successors. Afterwards he obtained a general exemption for himself and
his successors, from all Archbishops of Canterbury, which Abbot Hugh
had only acquired for himself personally. In these confirmations Abbot
Samson caused to be inserted many new privileges for the greater
liberty and security of our church.</p>

<p>There once came a certain clerk to the abbot, bearing letters of
request for procuring a benefice. And the abbot, drawing forth from
his desk seven apostolic writings, with the leaden seals hanging to
them, made answer: "Look at these apostolic writings, whereby divers
popes require that certain benefices should be given to divers clerks.
When I <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85">{85}</a></span>
shall have quieted those who have come before you, I will give you
your rent; for he who first cometh to the mill ought first to have his
grist."</p>

<p>There was a general court summoned for the hundred of Risbridge, to
hear the plaint and trial of the Earl of Clare, at Witham. He, indeed,
accompanied by many barons and knights, including the Earl Alberic and
many others, stated that his bailiffs had given him to understand that
they were accustomed to receive yearly for his use five shillings from
the hundred and the bailiffs of the hundred, and that this was now
unjustly detained; and he alleged that the land of Alfric, the son of
Withgar, who had in ancient time been lord of that hundred, had been
granted to his predecessors at the conquest of England. But the abbot,
taking thought for his own interest, without stirring from his place,
answered, "It is a strange thing, my lord earl; your case fails you.
King Edward the Confessor gave, and by his charter confirmed, to St.
Edmund, this entire hundred; and of those five shillings there is no
mention made therein. You must tell us for what service, or for what
reason, you demand those five shillings." And the earl, after advising
with his attendants, replied that it was his office to carry the
standard of St. Edmund in battle, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86"
id="page_86">{86}</a></span> and for that cause the five shillings were
due to him. The abbot answered, "Of a truth it seems a mean thing that
such a man as the Earl of Clare, should receive such a petty gift for
such a service. To the Abbot of St. Edmund, it is but a slight
grievance to give five shillings. The Earl Roger Bigot holds himself
as seised, and asserts that he is seised, of the office of bearing the
standard of St. Edmund; indeed, he actually did bear it when the earl
of Leicester was taken and the Flemings destroyed. Thomas of Mendham
also claims this as his right. When, therefore, you shall have proved
against these your right, I will with great pleasure pay you the five
shillings you now seek to recover of me." The earl upon this said that
he would talk the matter over with the Earl Roger, his kinsman, and so
the matter was put off even to this day.</p>

<p>On the death of Robert of Cockfield, there came Adam, his son, and
with him many of his relations, the Earl Roger Bigot, and many other
great men, and made suit to the abbot for the tenements of the
aforesaid Adam, and especially for the half hundred of Cosford, to be
held by the annual payment of one hundred shillings, just as if it had
been his hereditary right; indeed, they all said that his father and
his grandfather <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87"
id="page_87">{87}</a></span> had held it for fourscore years past and
more.</p>

<p>When the abbot got an opportunity of speaking, putting his two
fingers up to his two eyes, he said, "May I be deprived of these eyes
on that day, nay, in that hour, wherein I grant to any one a hundred
to be held in hereditary right, unless indeed the King, who is able to
take away from me the abbey and my life with it, should force me to do
so."</p>

<p>Explaining to them the reason of that saying, he averred, "If any
one were to hold a hundred as an inheritance, and he should make
forfeit to the King in any wise, so that he ought to lose his
inheritance, forthwith will the Sheriff of Suffolk and the King's
bailiffs have seisin of the hundred, and exercise their own power
within our liberties; and if they should have the ward of the hundred,
the liberty of the eight hundreds and a half will be endangered."</p>

<p>And then addressing himself to Adam, he said, "If you, who claim an
inheritance in this hundred, should take to wife any free woman who
should hold but one acre of land of the King in chief; the King, after
your death, would possess himself of all that your tenement, together
with the wardship of your son, if he be under age; and thus the King's
bailiffs would enter upon the hundred of St. Edmund, to the prejudice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span> of the
abbot. Besides all this, your father acknowledged to me that he
claimed nothing by right of inheritance in the hundred; but because
his service was satisfactory to me, I permitted him to hold it all the
days of his life, according as he deserved of me."</p>

<p>Upon the abbot saying thus much, money was offered; but he could
not be persuaded by words or money. At last it was settled between
them thus: Adam disclaimed the right which he had by word of mouth
claimed in the hundred, and the abbot confirmed to him all his other
lands; but touching our town of Cockfield, no mention was made of
that, nor indeed is it believed that he had a charter thereof; Semer
and Groton he was to hold for the term of his life.</p>

<p>Herbert the dean erected a windmill upon Haberdon. When the abbot
heard of this, his anger was so kindled that he would scarcely eat or
utter a single word. On the morrow, after hearing mass, he commanded
the sacrist, that without delay he should send his carpenters thither
and overturn it altogether, and carefully put by the wooden materials
in safe keeping.</p>

<p>The dean, hearing this, came to him saying that he was able in law
to do this upon his own frank fee, and that the benefit of the wind
ought not to be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89"
id="page_89">{89}</a></span> denied to any one. He further said that he
only wanted to grind his own corn there, and nobody else's, lest it
should be imagined that he did this to the damage of the neighbouring
mills. The abbot, his anger not yet appeased, answered, "I give you as
many thanks as if you had cut off both my feet; by the mouth of God I
will not eat bread until that building be plucked down. You are an old
man, and you should have known that it is not lawful even for the King
or his justiciary to alter or appoint a single thing within the
banlieue, without the permission of the abbot and convent; and why
have you presumed to do such a thing? Nor is this without prejudice to
my mills, as you assert, because the burgesses will run to you and
grind their corn at their pleasure, nor can I by law turn them away,
because they are freemen. Nor would I endure that the mill of our
cellarer, lately set up, should stand, except that it was erected
before I was abbot. Begone," he said, "begone; before you have come to
your house, you shall hear what has befallen your mill."</p>

<p>But the dean being afraid before the face of the abbot, by the
counsel of his son, Master Stephen, forestalled the servants of the
sacrist, and without delay caused that very mill which had been
erected by his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90"
id="page_90">{90}</a></span> own servants to be overthrown. So that when
the servants of the sacrist came thither, they found nothing to be
pulled down.</p>

<p>The abbot was sued in respect of the advowson of certain churches,
and gained the case. Certain others he also retained, although his
right thereto was challenged, viz., the church of Westley, of
Meringthorp, of Brettenham, of Wendling, of Pakenham, of Nowton, of
Bradfield in Norfolk, the moiety of the church of Boxford, the church
of Scaldwell, and the church of Endgate. All these, although the right
was challenged by others, he retained, and he restored to his own
right of patronage three portions of the church of Dickleburgh, and
brought back the tenements belonging to those shares to the frank fee
of the church, saving the service which was due therefrom to the manor
of Tivetshall. But the church of Boxford being void, when an inquest
was summoned thereupon, there came five knights tempting the abbot,
and inquiring what it was they ought to swear.</p>

<p>The abbot would neither give nor promise to them anything, but
said, "When the oath shall be administered, declare the right
according to your consciences." They, indeed, being discontented,
departed, and by their inquest took away from him the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">{91}</a></span> advowson of
that church, namely, the last presentation. Nevertheless, he
ultimately recovered it after many charges, and for a fine of ten
marks.</p>

<p>The abbot also retained the church of Honington. This had not
become vacant, but the right was challenged in the time of Durand of
Hostesley, although he produced as evidence of his right the charter
of William, Bishop of Norwich, wherein it was specified that Robert of
Valognes, his father-in-law, had given that church to Ernald
Lovell.</p>

<p>The moiety of the church of Hopton being void, a controversy arose
thereupon between the abbot and Robert of Elm; and a day of hearing
being appointed at Hopton, after much altercation, the abbot being
guided by I know not what sudden impulse, said to the aforesaid
Robert, "Do you but swear that this is your right, and I will allow
that it shall be so." And since that knight refused to swear, it was
by the consent of each party, referred to the oath of sixteen lawful
men of the hundred, who swore that this belonged to the abbot as his
right. Gilbert Fitz-Ralph and Robert of Cockfield, lords of that fee,
were there present and consenting thereto.</p>

<p>Thereupon, Master Jordan de Ros, who had the charter of abbot Hugh,
as well as the charter of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_92"
id="page_92">{92}</a></span> the aforesaid Robert, starting forward, urged
that whichever of them succeeded in proving his claim to the church,
he (Jordan) might hold the parsonage, that he was parson of the whole
church, and that the clerk last deceased had been his vicar, rendering
him a yearly payment for that moiety. In proof thereof he produced the
charter of Walchelin the archdeacon.</p>

<p>The abbot, greatly moved and angry with him, never received him in
a friendly manner, until the said Jordan, in a chapter of the monks at
Thetford, at the abbot's instance, resigned into the hands of the
bishop there present that very moiety, without any reservation or
expectation of afterwards recovering the same, before a great
multitude of clerks. This done, the abbot said, "My lord bishop, I am
engaged by promise to bestow the rent upon some one your clerk; and I
now give this moiety of this church to whomsoever of your clerks you
will." Then the bishop requested that in a friendly manner it should
be given to the same Master Jordan; and so upon the presentation of
the abbot, Jordan got it back again.</p>

<p>Afterwards a controversy arose between the abbot and the same
Jordan, touching the land of Herard in Harlow, whether it were the
frank fee of the church or not. And when there was summoned a <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93">{93}</a></span> jury of twelve
knights to make inquest in the king's court, the inquest was taken in
the court of the abbot at Harlow, by the licence of Ranulf de
Glanville, and the recognitors swore that they never knew that land at
any time to have been separated from the church, but nevertheless that
land owed such service to the abbot as that to which the land of
Eustace, and certain other lands of laymen in the same town were
subject. At length it was agreed between them thus: Master Jordan in
full court acknowledged that land to be lay fee, and that he claimed
nothing therein, unless by the abbot's grace. He will therefore hold
that land all the days of his life, rendering yearly to the abbot
twelve pence for all services.</p>

<p>Since, according to the custom of the English, many persons gave
many presents to the abbot, as being their head, upon the day of the
Circumcision of our Lord, I, Jocelin, thought to myself, What can I
give? And I began to reduce into writing all those churches which are
in the gift of the abbot, as well of our manors as of his, and the
reasonable values of the same, upon the same principle that they could
be fairly set to farm, at a time when corn is at its ordinary standard
price. And, therefore, upon the commencement of a new year, I gave to
the abbot <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94"
id="page_94">{94}</a></span> that schedule, as a gift to him, which he
received very gratefully.</p>

<p>I, indeed, because I then was pleasing in his sight, thought in my
heart, that I should hint to him that some one church should be given
to the convent, and assigned for the purposes of hospitality, just as
he had wished when he was a poor cloister monk: for this same thing he
himself had, before his election, suggested the brethren should swear,
that upon whomsoever the lot should fall, that man should do it. But
while I thought upon these things, I remembered that some one
previously had said the very same thing, and that I had heard the
abbot reply, that he could not dismember the barony; in other words,
that he ought not to diminish the liberty and dignity which abbot Hugh
and others his predecessors had had, of giving away churches, which
after all scarcely brought any gain or profit to the convent. On
considering this, I held my peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96">{96}</a></span> The
two counties of Norfolk and Suffolk were put in the "mercy" of the
King by the justices in eyre for some default, and fifty marks were
put upon Norfolk, and thirty upon Suffolk. And when a certain portion
of that common amerciament was assessed upon the lands of St. Edmund,
and was sharply demanded, the abbot, without any delay, went to our
lord the King. We found him at Clarendon; and when the charter of King
Edward, which discharges all the lands of St. Edmund from all gelds
and scots, had been shown to him, the King commanded by his writ that
six knights of the county of Norfolk and six of Suffolk should be
summoned to consider before the barons of the exchequer, whether the
lordships of St. Edmund ought to be quit from common amerciament. To
save trouble and expense, only six knights were chosen, and these for
the reason that they had lands in either county; namely, Hubert of
Briseword, W. Fitz-Hervey, and William of Francheville, and three
others, who went to London with us, and on behalf of the two counties
gave their verdict in favour of the liberty of our church. And
thereupon the justices then sitting enrolled their verdict.</p>

<p>The abbot Samson entered into a contest with his <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97">{97}</a></span>
knights&mdash;himself against all, and all of them against him. He had
stated to them that they ought to perform the service of fifty
individual knights in escuages, in aids, and the like, because, as
they themselves said, they held so many knights' fees. The point in
dispute was, why ten of those fifty knights were to be without
performing service, or by what reason or by whose authority the forty
should receive the help of those ten knights. But they all answered
with one voice, that such had ever been the custom, that is to say,
that ten of them should assist the other forty, and that they could
not thereupon&mdash;nor ought they thereupon&mdash;to answer, nor yet to
implead.</p>

<p>When they were summoned in the King's court to answer hereupon,
some, by arrangement, excused themselves from appearing, the others
cunningly appeared, saying that they ought not to answer without their
peers. On another occasion, those presented themselves who had first
absented themselves, saying in like manner, that they ought not to
answer without their peers who were joined with them in the same
plaint. And when they had several times thus mocked the abbot, and had
involved him in great and grievous expenses, the abbot complained of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_98" id="page_98">{98}</a></span> this to
Hubert, the archbishop, then justiciary, who replied in open court
that each knight ought to plead singly, and in respect of his own
tenure, and said straight out that the abbot was clever enough and
able enough to prove the rights of his church against all and every
one of them. Then the earl, Roger Bigot, first of all freely confessed
that, in law, he owed to his superior lord the abbot his service of
three entire knights' fees, in reliefs as well as in escuages and
aids; but, so far as concerned his performing castle-guard at the
castle of Norwich, he said nothing.</p>

<p>Next came two of these knights, then three, and again more, until
nearly all of them had come, and, by the earl's example, acknowledged
the same service. Because such acknowledgment thereupon made in the
court of St. Edmund was not sufficient in law, the abbot took all of
them to London at his own charges, with the wives and women who were
inherited of the lands so held, that they should make the
acknowledgment in the King's court, and they all received separate
charters of the concord thus made. Alberic de Vere and William of
Hastings and two others were in the King's service beyond sea when
this was done, and therefore the plaint concerning them was stayed.
Alberic de Vere was the last who held out <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_99" id="page_99">{99}</a></span> against the abbot; but as it
was, the abbot seized and sold his cattle, wherefore it behoved him to
come into court, and answer, as did his fellows. Taking advice upon
it, he at length acknowledged to the abbot and St. Edmund their
right.</p>

<p>The knights, therefore, being all defeated, a great profit would
have accrued to the abbot from this victory unless he had been
inclined to spare some of them; for so often as twenty shillings are
charged upon a fee, there will remain twelve pounds to the abbot, and
if more or less are assessed, more or less will remain over as a
surplus to him, according to the strict apportionment. Also the abbot
was wont, as were his predecessors, at the end of every twenty weeks
to give seven shillings for the guard of the castle of Norwich out of
his own purse, for default of three knights, whose fees Roger Bigot
holds of St. Edmund. Each of the knights of four constabularies used
to give twenty-eight pence when they entered to perform their guards,
and one penny to the marshal who collected those pence; and they were
accustomed to give twenty-eight pence and no more, because the ten
knights of the fifth constabulary ought to assist the other forty, so
that whereas they ought to have given three shillings entire, they
only gave twenty-nine <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100"
id="page_100">{100}</a></span> pence, and he whose duty it was to enter to
perform his guard service at the end of four months, entered at the
end of twenty weeks. But at the present time all the knights give the
full three shillings, and there remains to the abbot the surplus which
accrues beyond twenty-nine pence, from whence he can re-imburse
himself of the aforesaid seven shillings. It is apparent what force
had the words of the abbot which he spoke the first day, when he took
the homage of his knights, as aforesaid, when all the knights promised
him twenty shillings, and immediately revoked what they had said,
refusing to give him more than forty pounds in one sum, alleging that
ten knights ought to assist the other forty in aids and castle-guards,
and all such like services.</p>

<p>There is certain land in Tivetshall of the abbot's fee, which used
to pay to the watchmen of the castle of Norwich waite-fee, that is,
twenty shillings per annum, payable five shillings on each of the four
Ember fasts. This is an ancient customary payment which the abbot
would well wish to do away with if he could, but considering his
inability to do so, he has up to now held his peace and closed his
eyes to it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smcap">the case of henry of essex</span></h2>


<p class="nodent"><span class="dropcap">[F</span>OR the purpose of
diffusing the knowledge of the blessed King and martyr, we have
annexed this, we hope not irrelevantly, to the foregoing. Not that I
who am so insignificant a person, and of scarcely any account, should
set it forth with a historical title; but insomuch as Master Jocelin,
our almoner, a man of exalted piety, powerful in word and deed, did so
begin it at the request and desire of his superior, I may look upon it
as my own work, because, according to the precept of Seneca, whatever
has been well said by another, I may without presumption ascribe to
myself.</p>

<p>When the abbot came to Reading, and we with him, we were suitably
entertained by the monks of that place, among whom we met Henry of
Essex, a professed monk, who, having obtained an opportunity of
speaking with the abbot, related to him and ourselves as we all sat
together, how he was vanquished <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102"
id="page_102">{102}</a></span> in duel, and how and for what reason St.
Edmund had confounded him in the very hour of battle. I therefore
reduced his tale into writing by the command of the lord abbot, and
wrote it in these words.</p>

<p>As it is impossible for us to shun evil unless it be apparent, we
have thought it worthy to commit to historical record the acts and
excesses of Henry of Essex, as a warning and not for imitation. The
warnings that can be enforced by anecdotes are useful and beneficial.
The aforesaid Henry, therefore, while in prosperity was in high esteem
amongst the great men of the realm, a man of much account, of noble
birth, conspicuous by deeds of arms, the king's standard-bearer, and
feared by all on account of his power. His neighbours endowed the
church of St. Edmund, the King and martyr, with possessions and rents;
but he not only shut his eyes to this fact, but also by force and by
injuries, with violence and evil speaking, wrongfully withheld an
annual rent of five shillings, and converted it to his own use. Nay,
indeed, in process of time, when a cause touching the rape of a
certain damsel was prosecuted in the court of St. Edmund, the said
Henry came thither, protesting and alleging that the same plaint by
law ought to be decided in his court, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_103" id="page_103">{103}</a></span> in view of the birthplace
of the same damsel, who was born within his lordship of Lailand; and
by reason of this pretext he presumed to harass the court of St.
Edmund with journeys and innumerable expenses for a long space of
time.</p>

<p>In the meantime, in these and such like acts, fortune, smiling upon
his desires, suddenly brought in upon him the cause of perpetual
sorrow, and, under the appearance of a joyful beginning, she contrived
for him a joyless end; for she is wont to smile that she may
afterwards rage, to flatter that she may deceive, to raise up that she
may cast down. All at once, there rose up against him Robert of
Montfort, his kinsman and equal in birth and power, impeaching and
accusing him before the princes of the land, of treason against the
King. For he asserted that Henry, in the war with the Welsh, in the
difficult pass of Coleshill, had traitorously thrown down the standard
of our lord the King, and had with a loud voice proclaimed his death,
and so turned to flight those who were hastening to his assistance. In
point of fact, the aforesaid Henry of Essex did believe that the
famous King Henry the Second, who had been intercepted by the
stratagems of the Welsh, had been killed; and this would indeed have
been the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104"
id="page_104">{104}</a></span> case, if Roger Earl of Clare, illustrious
(clarus) by reason of birth, and more illustrious by deeds of valour,
had not come up in good time with his Clare men, and raised the
standard of our lord the King, to the encouragement and heartening of
the whole army. Henry, indeed, strenuously opposed the aforesaid
Robert in a speech, and absolutely denied the accusation, so that
after a short lapse of time it came to a trial by battle. And they
came to Reading to fight in a certain island hard by the abbey; and
thither also came a multitude to see what issue the matter would
take.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass, while Robert of Montfort thundered upon him
manfully with hard and frequent strokes, and a bold onset had promised
the fruit of victory, Henry, his strength a little failing him,
glanced round on all sides, and lo! on the border of the land and
water he saw the glorious King and martyr, Edmund, armed, and as if
hovering in the air, looking towards him with a severe countenance,
shaking his head with threats of anger and indignation. He also saw
with him another knight, Gilbert of Cereville, not only in appearance
inferior, but less in stature from the shoulders, direct his eyes upon
him as if angry and wrathful. This man, by the order of the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105">{105}</a></span> same Henry,
had been afflicted with chains and torments, and had closed his days
in prison at the instance and on the accusation of Henry's wife; who,
turning her own wickedness upon an innocent person, stated that she
could not endure the solicitations of Gilbert to unlawful love.
Therefore, Henry, on sight of these apparitions, became anxious and
fear-stricken, and remembered that old crime brings new shame.
Becoming wholly desperate, and changing reason into violence, he
assumed the part of one who attacked, not one who was on the
defensive; who, while he struck fiercely, was more fiercely struck;
and while he manfully fought, was more manfully attacked in his turn.
In short, he fell vanquished.</p>

<p>As he was believed to be dead, upon the petition of the great men
of England, his kinsmen, it was permitted that the monks of that place
should give his body the rites of sepulture. Nevertheless, he
afterwards recovered, and now with restored health, he has wiped out
the blot upon his previous life under the regular habit, and in his
endeavour to cleanse the long week of his dissolute life by at least
one purifying sabbath, has so cultivated the studies of the virtues,
as to bring forth the fruit of happiness.]</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smcap">troubles without</span></h2>


<p class="nodent"><span class="dropcap">G</span>EOFFREY Ridel, Bishop
of Ely, sought from the abbot some timber for the purpose of
constructing certain great buildings at Glemsford. This request the
abbot granted, but against his will, not daring to offend him. Now the
abbot making some stay at Melford, there came a certain clerk of the
bishop, asking on behalf of his lord, that the promised timber might
be taken at Elmswell; and he made a mistake in the word, saying
Elmswell when he should have said Elmsett, which is the name of a
certain wood at Melford. And the abbot was astonished at the request,
for such timber was not to be found at Elmswell.</p>

<p>Now when Richard the forester of the same town had heard of this,
he secretly informed the abbot that the bishop had the previous week
sent his carpenters to spy out the wood of Elmsett, and <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107">{107}</a></span> had chosen
the best timber trees in the whole wood, and placed his marks thereon.
On hearing this, the abbot directly discovered that the messenger of
the bishop had made an error in his request, and answered that he
would willingly do as the bishop pleased.</p>

<p>On the morrow, upon the departure of the messenger, immediately
after he had heard mass, the abbot went into the before-named wood
with his carpenters, and caused to be branded with his mark not only
all the oaks previously marked, but more than a hundred others, for
the use of St. Edmund, and for the steeple of the great tower,
commanding that they should be felled as quickly as possible. When the
bishop, by the answer of his messenger, understood that the aforesaid
timber might be taken at Elmswell, he sent back the same messenger
(whom he overwhelmed with many hard words) to the abbot, in order that
he might correct the word which he had mistaken, by saying Elmsett,
not Elmswell. But before he had come to the abbot, all the trees which
the bishop desired and his carpenters had marked were felled. So the
bishop, if he wanted timber, had to get other timber elsewhere. As for
myself, when I witnessed this affair, I laughed, and said in my heart,
"Thus art is deceived by art."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">{108}</a></span> On
the death of Abbot Hugh, the wardens of the abbey desired to depose
the bailiffs of the town of St. Edmund, and to appoint new bailiffs of
their own authority, saying that this appertained to the King, in
whose hand the abbey then was. But we, complaining thereof, sent our
messengers to lord Ranulf de Glanville, then justiciary. He answered,
that he well knew that forty pounds a year ought to be paid from the
town to our sacrist, specially for the lights of the church; and he
said that Abbot Hugh, of his own will, and in his privy chamber,
without the consent of the convent, had granted the bailiwick as often
as he chose, and unto whom he chose, saving the forty pounds payable
to the altar. And therefore it was not to be wondered at if the King's
bailiffs required this same thing on the King's behalf. Speaking in
bitter language, he called all our monks fools for having permitted
our abbot to do such things, not considering that the chief duty of
monks is to hold their peace, and pass over with closed eyes the
excesses of their prelates; nor yet considering that they are called
barrators if they, whether it be right or wrong, contravene their
superiors in anything; and, further, that sometimes we are accused of
treason and are condemned to prison and to exile. Wherefore <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109">{109}</a></span> it seems to
myself and others the better counsel to die as confessors rather than
as martyrs.</p>

<p>On the return of our messenger home, and on his relating what he
had seen and heard, we, as being unwilling and, as it were, under
compulsion, resolved, so far as we were able, that the old bailiffs of
the town should be deposed, as well with the common consent of the
convent, as by the keepers of the abbey. Samson, then sub-sacrist, was
very reluctant to join in this proposition. However, when Samson was
made abbot, he, calling to remembrance the wrong done to the abbey, on
the morrow after the Easter following his election, caused to be
assembled in our chapter-house the knights and clerks, and a number of
the burgesses, and then in the presence of them all, said that the
town belonged to the convent and to the altar, namely, to find tapers
for the church; and that he was desirous of renewing the ancient
custom, so that in the presence of the convent, and with the consent
of all, some measure should be taken concerning the bailiwick of the
town, and of such like matters which appertained to the convent.</p>

<p>At that time were nominated two burgesses, Godfrey and Nicholas, to
be bailiffs; and a discussion taking place from whose hand they should
receive the horn, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110"
id="page_110">{110}</a></span> which is called the moot-horn, at last they
took it from the hands of the prior, who, next to the abbot, is head
over the affairs of the convent.</p>

<p>Now these two bailiffs kept their bailiwick in peace many years,
until they were said to be remiss in keeping the King's justice. On
the abbot's suggestion that greater security should be given to the
convent upon this point, they were removed, and Hugh the sacrist took
the town into his own keeping, appointing new officers, who were to
answer to him concerning the bailiwick. In process of time, I know not
how, new bailiffs were subsequently appointed, and that elsewhere than
in chapter, and without the concurrence of the church; wherefore a
like or perhaps greater peril is to be apprehended after the decease
of Abbot Samson than even was after the death of Abbot Hugh.</p>

<p>One of our brethren, too, fully relying upon the regard and
friendship of the abbot, upon a fit opportunity and with propriety and
decency, talked over the matter with him, asserting that
dissatisfaction was expressed in the convent. But the abbot upon
hearing this was silent for a long time, as if he was somewhat
disturbed. At length he is reported to have said, "Am not I, even I,
the abbot? Does it not belong <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_111"
id="page_111">{111}</a></span> to me alone to make order concerning the
affairs of the church committed to my care, provided only that I
should act with wisdom and according to God's will? If there should be
default in the administration of the King's justice in this town, I
shall be challenged for it; I shall be summoned; upon myself alone
will rest the burden of the journey, and the expenses, and the defence
of the town and its appurtenances; I alone shall be deemed a fool, not
the prior, not the sacrist, nor yet the convent, but myself, who am
and ought to be their head. Through me and my counsel, with God's
assistance, will the town be securely preserved to the best of my
ability, and safe also will be those forty pounds payable annually to
the altar. Let the brethren grumble, let them slander me, let them say
amongst themselves what they will, I am still their father and their
abbot; so long as I live 'I will not give my glory to another.'" This
said, that monk departed, and reported these answers to us.</p>

<p>I for my part marvelled at such sayings, and argued with myself in
various ways. At length I was compelled to remain in a state of doubt,
inasmuch as the rule of law says and teaches, that all things should
be under the governance of the abbot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112">{112}</a></span>
The merchants of London claimed to be quit of toll at the fair of St.
Edmund. Nevertheless many paid it, unwillingly indeed, and under
compulsion; whereof a great tumult and commotion was made among the
citizens in London at their hustings. They came in a body and informed
Abbot Samson that they were entitled to be quit of toll throughout all
England, by authority of the charter which they had from King Henry
the Second. The abbot answered that were it necessary, he was well
able to vouch the King to warrant that he had never granted them any
charter to the prejudice of our church, or to the prejudice of the
liberties of St. Edmund, to whom St. Edward had granted and confirmed
toll and theam and all regalities before the conquest of England; and
that King Henry had done no more than give to the Londoners an
exemption from toll throughout his own lordships, and in places where
he was able to grant it; but so far as concerned the town of St.
Edmund he was not able so to do, for it was not his to dispose of. The
Londoners, hearing this, ordered by common council that none of them
should go to the fair of St. Edmund. For two years they kept away,
whereby our fair sustained great loss, and the offering of the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113">{113}</a></span> sacrist was
much diminished. At last, upon the mediation of the Bishop of London
and many others, it was settled between us and them that they should
come to the fair, and that some of them should pay toll, but that it
should be forthwith returned to them, that by such a colourable act
the privilege on both sides should be preserved.</p>

<p>But in process of time, when the abbot had made agreement with his
knights, and as it were slept in tranquillity, behold again "the
Philistines be upon thee, Samson!" Lo! the Londoners, with one voice,
were threatening that they would lay level with the earth the stone
houses which the abbot had built that very year, or that they would
take distress by a hundredfold from the men of St. Edmund, unless the
abbot forthwith redressed the wrong done them by the bailiffs of the
town of St. Edmund, who had taken fifteen pence from the carts of the
citizens of London, who in their way from Yarmouth, laden with
herrings, had made passage through our demesnes. Furthermore, the
citizens of London said that they were quit of toll in every market,
and on every occasion, and in every place throughout all England, from
the time when Rome was first founded, and that London was founded at
the very <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114"
id="page_114">{114}</a></span> same time. Also, that they ought to have
such an exemption throughout all England, as well by reason of its
being a privileged city, which was of old time the metropolis and head
of the kingdom, as by reason of its antiquity. The abbot asked that
the matter might be deferred until the return of our lord the King to
England, that he might consult with him upon this; and having taken
advice of the lawyers, he replevied to the claimants those fifteen
pence, without prejudice to the question of each party's right.</p>

<p>In the tenth year of the abbacy of Abbot Samson, by the common
counsel of our chapter, we complained to the abbot in his own hall,
stating that the rents and issues of all the good towns and boroughs
of England were increasing and augmenting, to the profit of the
possessors, and the well-thriving of their lords, all except this our
town, which had long yielded forty pounds, and had never gone beyond
that sum; and that the burgesses of the town were the cause of this
thing. For they held so large and so many standings in the
market-place, of shops and sheds and stalls, without the assent of the
convent, indeed from the sole gift of the bailiffs of the town, who in
old time were but yearly renters, and, as it were, ministers of the
sacrist, and were <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115"
id="page_115">{115}</a></span> removable at his good pleasure. The
burgesses, being summoned, made answer that they were under the
jurisdiction of the King's courts, nor would they make answer in
derogation of the immunity of the town and their charters, in respect
of the tenements which they and their fathers had holden well and
peaceably for one year and a day without claim. They also said the old
custom had been that the bailiffs should, without the interference of
the convent, dispose of the places of the shops and sheds in the
market-place, in consideration of a certain rent payable yearly to the
bailiwick. But we, gainsaying this, were desirous that the abbot
should disseise them of tenements for which they had no warranty.</p>

<p>Now the abbot coming to our council, as if he were one of us, said
to us in private, that he was willing enough to do us right, according
to the best of his ability, but that he, nevertheless, was bound to
proceed in due course of law; nor could he, without the judgment of a
court, disseise his free men of their lands or rents, which they had
held for many years, were it justly or unjustly. If he should do this,
he said, he should fall into the King's mercy by the assize of the
realm. Therefore, the burgesses, taking counsel together, offered to
the convent a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116"
id="page_116">{116}</a></span> rent of one hundred shillings for the sake
of peace; and that they should hold their tenements as they had been
wont to do. But we, on the other hand, were by no means willing to
grant this, rather desiring to put that plaint in respite, hoping,
perhaps, in the time of another abbot, to recover all, or change the
place of the fair; and so the affair was deferred for many years.</p>

<p>When the abbot had returned from Germany, the burgesses offered him
sixty marks, and sued for his confirmation of the liberties of the
town, under the same form of words as Anselm, and Ording, and Hugh had
confirmed them; all which the abbot graciously accorded.
Notwithstanding our murmuring and grumbling, a charter was accordingly
made to them in the terms of his promise; and because it would have
been a shame and confusion to him if he had not been able to fulfil
his promise, we were not willing to contradict him, or provoke him to
anger.</p>

<p>The burgesses, indeed, from the period when they had the charter of
Abbot Samson and the convent, became more confident that they, at
least in the time of Abbot Samson, would not lose their tenements or
their franchises; so that never afterwards, as they did before, were
they willing to pay or offer the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117"
id="page_117">{117}</a></span> before-named rent of one hundred shillings.
At length, however, the abbot giving attention to this matter,
discoursed with the burgesses hereupon, saying that unless they made
their peace with the convent, he should forbid their erecting their
booths at the fair of St. Edmund.</p>

<p>They, on the other hand, answered that they were willing to give
every year a silken cope, or some other ornament, to the value of one
hundred shillings, as they had before promised to do; but
nevertheless, upon this condition, that they were to be for ever quit
of the tithes of their profits, which the sacrist sharply demanded of
them. The abbot and the sacrist both refused this, and therefore the
plaint was again put in respite.</p>

<p>In point of fact, we have from that time to the present lost those
hundred shillings, according to the old saying, "He that will not when
he may, when he will he shall have nay."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118" id="page_118">{118}</a></span><br /></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smcap">troubles within</span></h2>


<p class="nodent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE cellarers quickly
succeeded each other, and every one of them at the year's end became
involved in a great debt. There were given to the cellarer, in aid,
twenty pounds out of Mildenhall, but this did not suffice. After that,
fifty pounds were assigned to the cellarer each year from the same
manor; and yet the cellarer used to say that this was not enough. The
abbot, therefore, being anxious to provide for his security from loss
and comfort, as well as for our own, knowing that in all our wants we
must have recourse to him as to the father of the monastery,
associated with the cellarer a certain clerk of his own table, by name
Ranulf, so that he might assist him both as a witness and companion in
the expenses and receipts. And lo! many of us speak many things,
murmurings thicken, falsehoods are invented, scandals are interwoven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_119" id="page_119">{119}</a></span> with
scandals, nor is there a corner in the house which does not resound
with venomous hissing.</p>

<p>One says to another, "What is this that is done? Who ever saw the
like? There never was such an insult offered to the convent before.
Behold! the abbot has set a clerk over a monk; see, he has made a
clerk a master and keeper over the cellarer, as if he could do no good
without him. The abbot thinks but lightly of his monks; he suspects
his monks; he consults clerks; he loves clerks. 'How is the gold
become dim! How is the fine gold changed!'" Also one friend says to
another, "We are become a reproach to our neighbours. All of us monks
are either reckoned faithless or improvident; the clerk is believed,
the monk is not. The abbot had rather trust the clerk than the monk.
Now is this clerk a whit more faithful or wise than a monk would
be?"</p>

<p>And again, one friend would say to another, "Are not the cellarer
and sub-cellarer, or can they not be, as faithful as the sacrist or
the chamberlain? The consequence is, that this abbot or his successor
will put a clerk along with the sacrist, a clerk with the chamberlain,
a clerk with the sub-sacrists to collect the offerings at the shrine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_120" id="page_120">{120}</a></span> and
so on with all the officials, wherefore we shall be a laughing-stock
and derision to the whole people."</p>

<p>I, hearing these things, was accustomed to answer, "If I, for my
part, were cellarer, I had rather that a clerk were a witness for me
in all my transactions; for if I did well he would bear witness of the
good. If, again, I had, at the end of the year, become laden with
debt, I should be able to gain credence and to be excused by the
testimony of that clerk."</p>

<p>I heard, indeed, one of our brethren, a man truly discreet and
learned, say something upon this subject which struck myself and
others very much. "It is not," he said, "to be wondered at, should the
lord abbot interpose his exertions in the safe conduct of our affairs,
especially as he wisely manages that portion of the abbey which
belongs to him, and is discreet in the disposing of his own house, it
being his part to supply our wants in case of our carelessness or
inability to do so. But there is one thing," he added, "which will
prove dangerous after the death of the abbot Samson, such as has never
come to pass in our days or in our lives. Of a surety the King's
bailiffs will come, and will possess themselves of the abbey, I mean
the barony which belongs to the abbot, as was done in the past after
the deaths of other <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_121"
id="page_121">{121}</a></span> Abbots. As after the death of Abbot Hugh,
the King's bailiffs likewise desired to appoint new bailiffs in the
town of St. Edmund, alleging as their warrant that Abbot Hugh had done
this, in the same way the King's bailiffs will, in process of time,
appoint their clerk to keep the cellary, in order that everything
shall be done therein by him, and under his discretion. And then we
shall be told that they are entitled to act in this manner because
Abbot Samson did so. Thus they will have the power of intermixing and
confusing all the concerns and rents of the abbot and of the convent;
all which, indeed, Abbot Robert, of good memory, had, with due
consideration, distinguished in account, and had separated one from
the other."</p>

<p>When I heard these and such like expressions from a man of great
thought and foresight, I was astonished, and held my peace, not
wishing either to condemn the lord abbot, or to excuse him.</p>

<p>Hubert Walter, the Archbishop of Canterbury and legate of the
apostolic see, and Justiciary of England, after he had visited many
churches, and had by right of his legation made many changes and
alterations, was on his way home from his natural mother, who lived at
Dereham and was then dying. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122"
id="page_122">{122}</a></span> He sent two of his clerks over to us,
bearing the sealed letters of their lord, wherein it was contained
that we should give credit to what they should say and do. These men
inquired of the abbot and convent whether we were willing to receive
their lord, the legate, who was on his way to us, in such wise as a
legate ought to be received, and, in fact, is received by other
churches. If we were agreed to this, he would shortly come to us, for
the purpose of making order concerning the matters and affairs of our
church according to God's will; but if we were not agreed, those two
clerks could more fully communicate to us their lord's behest.
Thereupon the abbot called together most of the convent, and we came
to the decision that we would give a gracious answer to the clerks
thus sent to us, saying that we were willing to receive their lord as
legate with all honour and reverence, and to send together with them
our own messengers, who, on our part, should communicate the same to
the lord legate.</p>

<p>Our intention was that, in the same way as we had done to the
Bishop of Ely and other legates, we would show him all possible
honour, with a procession and ringing of bells, and would receive him
with the usual solemnities, until it should <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_123" id="page_123">{123}</a></span> come to the point, perhaps,
of his holding a visitation in chapter. If he were to proceed in doing
this, then all of us were to oppose him might and main to his face,
appealing to Rome, and standing upon our charters. And the lord abbot
said, "If at this present time the legate will come to us, we will do
as is aforesaid, but if indeed he shall defer his arrival to us for a
time, we will consult the lord Pope, and inquire what force the
privileges of our church ought to have, as being those which have been
obtained from him and his predecessors, against the archbishop who has
now obtained power from the apostolic see over all the privileged
churches of England." Such was our determination.</p>

<p>When the archbishop had heard that we were willing to receive him
as legate, he received our messengers graciously and with giving of
thanks. And he became favourable and kindly disposed towards the lord
abbot in all his concerns, and for certain pressing causes deferred
his visit to us for a time. Therefore, without the least delay, the
abbot sent to the Pope the same letters which the legate had sent to
him and the convent, wherein it was contained that he was about to
come to us by authority of his legation, and by the authority of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124">{124}</a></span> Pope,
and, moreover, that to him was given power over all the exempt
churches of England, notwithstanding the letters of exemption obtained
by the church of York or any other.</p>

<p>The abbot's messenger expediting the matter, our lord the Pope
wrote to the lord of Canterbury, asserting that our church, as his
spiritual daughter, ought not to be accountable to any legate, unless
he were a legate of our lord the Pope sent <i>a latere</i>, and
enjoined him that he should not stretch forth his hand against us; and
our lord the Pope added as from himself a prohibition against his
exercising jurisdiction over any other exempt church. Our messenger
returned to us, and this was kept a secret for many days.
Nevertheless, the same was intimated to the lord of Canterbury by some
of his adherents at the court of our lord the Pope.</p>

<p>When, at the end of the year, the legate made his visitation
through Norfolk and Suffolk, and had first arrived at Colchester, the
legate sent his messenger to the abbot, privately letting him thereby
know that he (the legate) had heard say that the abbot had obtained
letters contravening his legation, and requesting that he, in a
friendly way, would send him those letters. And it was done
accordingly, for <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_125"
id="page_125">{125}</a></span> the abbot had two counterparts of these
letters. The abbot, indeed, did not pay a visit to the legate, either
by himself or by proxy, so long as he was in the diocese of Norwich,
lest it should be thought that he wished to make fine with the legate
for his entertainment, as other monks and canons had done. The legate,
disconcerted and angry and fearing to be shut out if he came to us,
passed by Norwich, by Acre and by Dereham to Ely, on his way to
London.</p>

<p>The abbot meeting the legate within the month, between Waltham and
London, on the King's highway, the legate censured him for having
refused to meet him, as being justiciary of our lord the King whilst
he was in that country. The abbot answered that he had not travelled
as justiciary, but as legate, making visitation in every church; and
alleged the reason of the time of year, and that the passion of our
Lord was nigh at hand, and that it behoved him to be concerned with
Divine services and cloister duties.</p>

<p>When the abbot had opposed words to words, and objections to
objections, and could neither be bent nor intimidated by threatening
language, the legate replied with scorn that he well knew him to be a
keen wrangler, and that he was a better clerk than <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126">{126}</a></span> he, the
legate, was. The abbot, therefore, not timidly passing by matters
inexpedient to allude to, nor yet arrogantly speaking upon matters
that were to be discussed, in the hearing of many persons made answer
that he was a man who would never suffer the privileges of his church
to be shaken either for want of learning or money, even if it should
come to pass that he lost his life, or was condemned to perpetual
banishment. However, these and other altercations being brought to a
close, the legate began to flush in the face, upon the abbot lowering
his tone and beseeching him that he would deal more gently with the
church of St. Edmund, by reason of his native soil, for he was native
born of St. Edmund, and had been his fosterling. And, indeed, he had
reason to blush, because he had so unadvisedly outpoured the venom
which he had bred within him.</p>

<p>On the morrow it was communicated to the Archbishop of Canterbury,
that the lord Archbishop of York was about to come as legate into
England, and that he had suggested many evil things to the Pope
concerning him, stating that he had oppressed the churches of England
by reason of his visitation to the extent of thirty thousand marks,
which he had <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_127"
id="page_127">{127}</a></span> received from them. The legate, therefore,
sent his clerks to the abbot, begging him that he would, with the
other abbots, write to our lord the Pope and justify him.</p>

<p>This the abbot willingly did, and thereby offered his testimony
that the lord of Canterbury had not been to our church, nor had he
oppressed any other church, speaking according to his conscience. And
when the abbot had delivered those letters to the messengers of the
archbishop, he said before us all that he did not fear, even if it
were the archbishop's wish to deal deceitfully with those letters. The
clerks answered on the peril of their souls, that their lord did not
contemplate any subtle dealings, but only wished to be justified. And
so the archbishop and the abbot were made friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_128" id="page_128">{128}</a></span><br /></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smcap">samson's contests with knights, monks and townsmen</span></h2>


<p class="nodent"><span class="dropcap">K</span>ING Richard commanded
all the bishops and abbots of England that for every nine knights of
their baronies they should make a tenth knight, and that without delay
those knights should go to him in Normandy, with horses and arms, in
aid against the King of France. Wherefore it behoved the abbot to
account to him for sending four knights. And when he had caused to be
summoned all his knights, and had conferred with them thereon, they
made answer that their fees, which they had holden of St. Edmund, were
not liable to this charge, neither had they or their fathers ever gone
out of England, although they had, on some occasions, paid escuage by
the King's writ.</p>

<p>The abbot was indeed in a strait; on one hand observing that hereby
the liberty of his knights <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_129"
id="page_129">{129}</a></span> was in peril, on the other hand
apprehending that he might lose the seisin of his barony for default
in the King's service, as indeed had befallen the Bishop of London and
many English barons. So he forthwith went beyond seas to the King; and
though fatigued with many troubles and expenses, and very many
presents which he gave the King, in the first instance he could make
no agreement with the King by money. For the King said that he did not
want either silver or gold, but that he instantly required four
knights; whereupon the abbot obtained four mercenaries. When the King
had got these, he sent them to the Castle of Eu, and the abbot paid
them thirty-six marks down for their expenses for forty days.</p>

<p>Now on the morrow, there came certain of the King's attendants, and
recommended the abbot to carefully look to what he was about, stating
that the war might possibly last a whole year or more, and that the
expenses of the knights would consequently increase and multiply, to
the endless damage of him and his church. They therefore advised him
that before he left the court he should make fine with the King, so
that he might be quit in respect of the service of the aforesaid
knights after the forty days <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_130"
id="page_130">{130}</a></span> were passed. The abbot, having adopted this
good counsel, gave to the King one hundred pounds for such a
quittance. Thus being in favour with his sovereign, he returned to
England, bringing with him the King's writ, commanding that his
knights should be distrained by their fees to render him that King's
service which he had got performed for them.</p>

<p>The knights, being summoned, alleged their poverty and manifold
grievances, and prevailed upon their lord to accept two marks upon
every shield. The abbot, indeed, not forgetting that he had that same
year burdened them much, and had impleaded them to make them render
their escuage individually, was desirous of conciliating their esteem,
and in good part accepted what they with a good grace offered.</p>

<p>At that time, although the abbot had been put to great expenses
beyond sea, yet he did not return home to this church empty-handed;
for he brought with him a golden cross, and a most valuable copy of
the Gospels, of the value of fourscore marks. On another occasion when
he returned from beyond seas, sitting in chapter, he said that if he
had been cellarer or chamberlain he would have made some purchase
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_131" id="page_131">{131}</a></span> which
would have been serviceable to his office; and since he was abbot, he
ought to purchase something that should beseem him as abbot. After
saying this, he offered to the convent a valuable chasuble, and a
mitre interwoven with gold, and sandals with silken buskins, and the
head of a crozier of silver and well wrought. In like manner, so often
as he returned from beyond sea, he brought along with him some
ornament or other.</p>

<p>In the year of grace one thousand one hundred and ninety-seven,
certain innovations and alterations took place in our church, which
ought not to be passed over in silence. Insomuch as his ancient rents
were not sufficient for our cellarer, Abbot Samson ordered that fifty
pounds from Mildenhall should be given by way of increase to the
cellarer yearly by the hands of the prior, not all at one time, but by
monthly instalments, so that he should have something every month to
expend, and that it should not all be disbursed at one time of the
year.</p>

<p>And so it was done for one year. But the cellarer with his fellows
complained of this, saying that if he had that money in hand, he would
provide himself and preserve a sufficient stock. The abbot, although
unwillingly, granted his petition. Now, on the commencement <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_132" id="page_132">{132}</a></span> of the
month of August, the cellarer had already spent all, and, moreover,
was in debt twenty pounds, and a debt of fifty pounds was about to
fall due before Michaelmas.</p>

<p>Hearing of this, the abbot was wroth, and thus spoke in chapter: "I
have often and often threatened that I will take the cellarership into
my own hands on account of your default and improvidence, for all of
you keep incumbering yourselves with heavy debts. I put my own clerk
with your cellarer as a witness, and in order that matters should be
more advisedly managed; but there is neither clerk nor monk who dares
to inform me of the real cause of debt. It is nevertheless said that
excess of feasting in the prior's house, by the assent of the prior
and cellarer, and superfluous expenses in the guest-house by the
carelessness of the hospitaller, are the cause of all this. You see,"
he continued, "what a great debt is now pressing; give me your advice,
and tell me how this matter can be amended."</p>

<p>Many of the cloister folk hearing this, and half smiling, took what
was said in very good part, saying privily, "All that the abbot says
is true enough." The prior cast the blame upon the cellarer, the
cellarer in his turn upon the hospitaller; each one justified <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_133" id="page_133">{133}</a></span> himself. We
all of us well knew the truth of the matter, but we held our tongues,
for we were afraid. On the morrow came the abbot, and said again to
the convent: "Give me your opinion as to the means whereby your cellar
can be better and more economically managed." But there was no one who
answered, except one, who said that there was no superfluity at all in
the refectory which could occasion such a debt or pressure. On the
third day the abbot spoke the same words, and one answered, "That
advice ought to proceed from yourself, as from our head."</p>

<p>Then the abbot said, "As you will not state your opinion, and as
you are incapable of managing your house for yourselves, the
management of the monastery rests solely upon myself as father and
supreme keeper. I take," he said, "into my own hand your cellar and
the charge of the guests, and the stewardship of everything indoors
and out of doors." So saying he deposed the cellarer and hospitaller,
and put in their stead two other monks, under the style of
sub-cellarer and hospitaller, associating with them Master G., a clerk
of his own table, without whose assent nothing could be done, either
in respect of meat or drink, or in regard to disbursements or
receipts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_134" id="page_134">{134}</a></span>
The old purveyors were removed from their buying in the market, and
provisions were bought by the clerk of the abbot, and all deficiencies
were supplied out of the abbot's purse. The guests that ought to be
entertained were received, and the honourable were honoured; the
officials and monks, all of them alike, took their meals in the
refectory, and on all sides superfluous charges were retrenched.
However, some of the cloister monks said among themselves, "Seven, ay
seven there were who devoured our substance, of whose devourings if
any one did speak, he was accounted guilty of treason." Another would
say, stretching forth his hands to heaven, "Blessed be God, who hath
imparted this resolution to the abbot to correct such excesses"; and
very many of them said that it was well done. Others would say, "Not
so," they considering that such reform was an abatement of respect;
and they styled the prudence of the abbot the ferocity of a wolf.
Verily, they were again beginning to call their old dreams to mind,
that the future abbot was to rage as a wolf.</p>

<p>The knights marvelled and the townsfolk marvelled at the things
that came to pass, and some one of the common folk said, "It is a
strange thing that so many monks and learned men should permit their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_135" id="page_135">{135}</a></span>
possessions and rents to be confused and mingled with the possessions
of the abbot; especially as they have been always accustomed to be
kept distinct and apart from each other. It is strange also that they
take no heed of the peril that may befall them after the death of the
abbot if our lord the King should find them in such a condition."</p>

<p>Another person said that the abbot was the only one amongst them
who acted wisely in the governing of external affairs, and that he
ought to govern the whole who has the knowledge requisite to govern
the whole. And there was one who said, "If there had been but one wise
monk in such a large convent, who knew how to govern the house, the
abbot would not have done as he has." And so we became a
laughing-stock and a scoff to our neighbours.</p>

<p>About this time it came to pass that the anniversary obit of abbot
Robert was to be sung in chapter, and it was ordered that a
<i>placebo</i> and <i>dirige</i> should be sung more solemnly than
ordinarily, namely, with tolling of the great bells, as upon the
anniversaries of abbots Ording and Hugh, on account of the noble act
of the aforesaid abbot Robert, who made the division between our
possessions and rents, and the rents of the abbot. This <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_136" id="page_136">{136}</a></span> solemnity,
indeed, was performed by the advice of certain persons, so that thus
at least the heart of the lord abbot might thus be stirred up to do
what was right. There was also one who thought that this was done as a
reproach to the abbot, who, it was said, was desirous of confusing and
mingling together our and his possessions and rents, insomuch as he
had seized the cellarership into his own hands. The abbot, however,
hearing the unwonted noise of the bells, and well knowing and
observing that it was done against all usage, discreetly ignored the
reason of its being done, and solemnly chanted the mass.</p>

<p>Indeed, on the next Michaelmas day, desiring to appease the
murmurings of certain persons, he appointed him who had been formerly
sub-cellarer to be cellarer, and he ordered some other man to be named
sub-cellarer; the aforesaid clerk, nevertheless, remaining with them,
and managing all things as before. But when that clerk began to exceed
the bounds of temperance, saying, "I am Bu," meaning the cellarer,
when he had exceeded the bounds of temperance in drinking, and without
the knowledge of the abbot was holding the court of the cellarer,
taking gages and pledges, and receiving the annual rents, disbursing
them by his own <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_137"
id="page_137">{137}</a></span> hand, he was called by the people the chief
cellarer.</p>

<p>It was his habit to stroll about the court followed by a crowd of
debtors, rich and poor, and of suitors of all ranks preferring various
complaints, as if he were the master and high steward. On one such
occasion, one of our officers happened to be standing in the court,
and, upon seeing this, for confusion and shame, he wept outright,
considering that this was a disgrace to our church, pondering upon the
peril consequent thereon, and realizing that a clerk was preferred to
a monk, to the prejudice of the whole convent.</p>

<p>Therefore some one, who shall be nameless, undertook, through a
third party, that these things should be intimated to the abbot in a
proper and reasonable manner; and he was given to understand that this
species of arrogance in the clerk, which was committed to the disgrace
and dishonour of the society, was very likely to breed a great
disturbance and dissension in the convent. The abbot certainly did,
when he heard of this, forthwith summon the cellarer and the aforesaid
clerk before him, and gave orders that thenceforth the cellarer should
consider himself as cellarer in receiving moneys, in holding pleas,
and in all other things, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_138"
id="page_138">{138}</a></span> save that the aforesaid clerk should assist
him, not as an equal, but as a witness and adviser.</p>

<p>Hamo Blund, one of the wealthier men of this town, on his death-bed
could hardly be persuaded to make a will. At last he did, but disposed
of only three marks, and this in the hearing of no one, except his
brother, wife and chaplain. The abbot, ascertaining this after the
man's decease, called those three persons before him, and sharply
rebuked them, especially upon this point, that the brother (who was
his heir) and his wife would not suffer any one else to approach the
sick man, they desiring to take all. The abbot said in audience, "I
was his bishop, and had the charge of his soul; let not the folly of
his priest and confessor turn to my peril. Insomuch as I could not
advise the sick man when alive, I being absent, what concerns my
conscience I shall now perform, late though it be. I therefore command
that all his debts and his moveable chattels, which are worth, as it
is said, two hundred marks, be reduced into a writing, and that one
portion be given to the heir, and another to the wife, and the third
to his poor kinsfolk and other poor persons. As to the horse which was
led before the coffin of the deceased, and was offered to St. Edmund,
I order <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_139"
id="page_139">{139}</a></span> that it be sent back and returned; for it
does not beseem our church to be defiled with the gift of him who died
intestate, and whom common report accuses of being habitually wont to
put out his money to interest. By the face of God, if such a thing
came to pass of any one again in my days, he shall not be buried in
the churchyard!" On his saying these things, the others departed
greatly disconcerted.</p>

<p>On the morrow of the Nativity of our Lord, there took place in the
churchyard meetings, wrestlings, and matches, between the servants of
the abbot and the burgesses of the town; and from words they came to
blows, from cuffs to wounds and to the shedding of blood. The abbot,
hearing of this, called to him privately certain of those who were
present at the sight, but yet stood afar off, and ordered that the
names of the evil-doers should be set down in writing. All these he
caused to be summoned, that they should stand before him on the morrow
of St. Thomas the archbishop, in the chapel of St. Denis, to answer
therefor. Nor did he, in the meantime, invite to his own table any one
of the burgesses, as he had been wont to do, on the first five days of
Christmas.</p>

<p>On the day appointed, having taken the oaths from sixteen lawful
men, and having heard their evidence, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_140" id="page_140">{140}</a></span> the abbot said, "It is
manifest that these evil-doers have incurred the penalties of the
canon <i>latæ sententiæ</i>; but because both parties are laymen, and
do not understand what a crime it is to commit such a sacrilege as
this, I shall by name and publicly excommunicate them, in order that
others may be deterred from doing the like: and that in no wise there
be any diminution of justice, I shall first begin with my own
domestics and servants." And it was done accordingly, we putting on
our robes and lighting the candles. So they all went forth from the
church, and being advised so to do, they all stripped themselves, and
altogether naked, except their drawers, they prostrated themselves
before the door of the church.</p>

<p>When the assessors of the abbot had come, monks as well as clerks,
and informed him, with tears in their eyes, that more than a hundred
men were lying down thus naked, the abbot wept. Nevertheless, making a
show of legal severity both in word and countenance and concealing the
pity he felt, he desired to be persuaded by his counsellors that the
penitents should be absolved, knowing that mercy is exalted over
judgment, and that the church receives all penitents. Thereupon, they
being all sharply whipped and absolved, they <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_141" id="page_141">{141}</a></span> swore all of them that they
would abide by the judgment of the church for sacrilege committed.</p>

<p>On the morrow, penance was assigned to them, according to the
appointment of the canons; and thus the abbot restored all of them to
unity of concord, uttering terrible threats to all those who by word
or deed should furnish matter of discord.</p>

<p>Further, he publicly forbade meetings and shows to be had in the
churchyard; and so all things being brought to a state of peace, the
burgesses feasted on the following days with their lord the abbot,
with great joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_142" id="page_142">{142}</a></span><br /></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smcap">the cares of office</span></h2>


<p class="nodent"><span class="dropcap">A</span> COMMISSION of our
lord the Pope had been directed to Hubert, Archbishop of Canterbury,
and to the lord Bishop of Lincoln, and to Samson, Abbot of St. Edmund,
touching the reformation of the church of Coventry, and the
restoration of the monks thereto, without any revision of their case.
The parties being summoned to Oxford, the judges received letters of
request from our lord the King, that this business should be
respited.</p>

<p>The archbishop and the bishop, seeming to know nothing, were
silent, as if seeking the favour of the clerks. The abbot was the only
one who spoke out, and he did so as a monk for the monks of Coventry,
publicly advocating and defending their cause. And by his means it was
so far proceeded with on that day, that a certain simple seisin was
made to one of the monks of Coventry by delivery of one book. <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_143" id="page_143">{143}</a></span> But
corporate institution was deferred for a time, that so in some degree
the abbot might obey the request of our lord the King.</p>

<p>At that time he entertained in his inn fourteen monks of Coventry
who had appeared there; and when the monks were sitting at the table
on one side of the house, and the masters of the schools who had been
summoned thither on the other, the abbot was applauded as noble and
liberal in his expenses. Never in all his life did he seem so joyful
as at that time, for the reverence he bore towards reform of monastic
rule. The feast of St. Hilary being now at hand, the abbot journeyed
on to Coventry in high spirits, neither was he overcome by fatigue or
charges, for he said, that even if he had to be carried in a
horse-litter, he would not remain behind. On his arrival at Coventry,
where for five days he was waiting for the archbishop, he kept with
him all the afore-named monks, with their servants, in most honourable
fashion, until a new prior was created, and the monks had been
formally inducted. "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear," for it
is an act worthy to be had in remembrance.</p>

<p>After this the abbot Samson and Robert of Scales came to an
agreement concerning the moiety of <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_144" id="page_144">{144}</a></span> the advowson of the church
of Wetherden, and the same Robert acknowledged it to be the right of
St. Edmund and the abbot. Thereupon the abbot, without any previous
understanding taking place, and without any promise previously made,
gave that moiety which belonged to him to Master Roger of Scales,
brother of the same knight, upon this condition, that he should pay by
the hand of our sacrist an annual pension of three marks to that
master of the schools who should teach in the town of St. Edmund. This
the abbot did, being induced thereto by motives of remarkable
generosity; in order that as he had formerly purchased stone houses
for the use of the schools, that poor clerks should be free from house
rent, so now from thenceforth they might be freed from all demand of
moneys which the master of the school demanded by custom for his
teaching. And so, by God's will, and during the abbot's life, the
entire moiety of the aforesaid church, which is worth, as it is said,
one hundred shillings, was appropriated to such purposes.</p>

<p>Now the abbot, after that he had built in his vills throughout the
abbacy many and various edifices, and had taken up his quarters at his
manor houses oftener and more frequently than with us at home, at
length, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_145"
id="page_145">{145}</a></span> as if returning to himself, and as if
making good better, said that he would stay more at home than he had
been used to do; and would now erect some buildings within the court
for necessary purposes, having regard to internals and externals, and
as if he was aware that "the presence of the master is the profit of
the field." Therefore he gave directions that the stables and offices
in the court lodge and round about the same, formerly covered with
reeds, should be newly roofed, and covered with tiles, under the
supervision of Hugh the sacrist, so that thus all fear and risk of
fire might be prevented.</p>

<p>And now, behold the acceptable time, the day of desire, whereof I
write not but with great joy, myself having the care of the guests.
Lo! at the command of the abbot the court lodge resounds with spades
and masons' tools, for pulling down the guest-house; and now it is
almost all levelled. Of the rebuilding, let the Most High take
thought! The abbot built for himself a new larder in the court lodge,
and gave to the convent the old larder (which was situated, in a very
slovenly fashion, under the dorter) for the accommodation of the
chamberlain. The chapels of St. Andrew and St. Katherine and St. Faith
were newly covered with lead; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_146"
id="page_146">{146}</a></span> many repairs were also made, both inside
the church and without. If you do not believe, open your eyes and see.
Also in his time our almonry, which previously was of wood and out of
repair, was built in stone; whereto a certain brother of ours, Walter
the physician, at that time almoner, contributed much of what he had
acquired by his practice of physic.</p>

<p>The abbot also observing that the silver retable of the high altar,
and many other precious ornaments, had been alienated for the purpose
of the recovery of Mildenhall and the ransom of King Richard, was not
desirous of replacing that table or such-like matters, which upon a
similar occasion were liable to be torn away and misappropriated. He
therefore turned his attention to the making of a most valuable
cresting for the shrine of the glorious martyr Edmund, that his
ornament might be set in a place whence it could by no possibility be
abstracted, and whereon no human being would dare to put forth his
hand.</p>

<p>For indeed, when King Richard was captive in Germany, there was no
treasure in England that had not either to be given up or redeemed;
yet the shrine of St. Edmund remained untouched. However, the question
was raised before the justices of the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_147" id="page_147">{147}</a></span> exchequer, whether the
shrine of St. Edmund should not, at least in part, be stripped for the
ransom of King Richard. But the abbot standing up, answered, "Know ye
of a surety, that this never shall be done by me, nor is there a man
who can compel me to consent to it. But I will open the doors of the
church: let him enter who will, let him approach who dare." Each of
the justices replied with oaths, "I will not venture to approach it."
"Nor will I." "St. Edmund grievously punishes those who are far off as
well as those who are near at hand; how much more will he inflict
vengeance upon those who take away his vesture!"</p>

<p>Upon this neither was the shrine despoiled, nor redemption paid.
Therefore passing by other things, the abbot carefully and advisedly
turned his mind towards the making of a cresting for the shrine. And
now the plates of gold and silver resound between the hammer and the
anvil, and "the carpenters wield their tools."</p>

<p>Adam of Cockfield dying, left for his heir a daughter of three
months old; and the abbot gave the wardship of his fee to whom he
would. Now King Richard, being solicited by some of his courtiers,
anxiously sought for the wardship and the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_148" id="page_148">{148}</a></span> child for the benefit of
one of his servants; at one time by letters, at another time by
messengers.</p>

<p>But the abbot answered that he had given the ward away, and had
confirmed his gift by his charter. Sending his own messenger to the
King, he did all he could, by entreaty and good offices, to mitigate
his wrath. And the King made answer, with great indignation, that he
would avenge himself upon that proud abbot who had thwarted him, were
it not for reverence of St. Edmund, whom he feared. When the messenger
returned, the abbot very wisely passed over the King's threats without
notice, and said, "Let the King send, if he will, and seize the ward;
he has the strength and power of doing his will, indeed of taking away
the whole of the abbacy. I shall never be bent to his will in this
matter, nor by me shall this ever be done. For the thing that is most
to be apprehended is, lest such things be made a precedent to the
prejudice of my successors. On this business I will never give the
King money. Let the Most High look to it. Whatever may befall, I will
patiently bear."</p>

<p>Whilst, therefore, many were saying and believing that the King was
exasperated against the abbot, lo! the King wrote in a friendly way to
the abbot, and requested that he would give him some of his dogs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_149" id="page_149">{149}</a></span> The
abbot, not unmindful of that saying of the wise man&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Gifts, believe me, influence both men and gods,</span>
<span class="i2">By the offer of gifts Jove himself is appeased&mdash;</span>
</div>

<p class="nodent">sent the dogs as the King requested, and moreover,
added some horses and other valuable gifts. The King graciously
accepted them, and in public most highly commended the honesty and
fidelity of the abbot.</p>

<p>He also sent to the abbot by his messengers, as a token of intimacy
and affection, a ring of great price, which our lord the Pope,
Innocent the Third, of his great grace had given him, being indeed the
very first gift that had been offered after his consecration. Also, by
his writ, the King rendered him many thanks for the presents the abbot
had sent him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_150" id="page_150">{150}</a></span><br /></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smcap">the customs of the township</span></h2>


<p class="nodent"><span class="dropcap">M</span>ANY persons marvelled
at the changes in the customs that took place by the order or
permission of the lord abbot Samson. From the time when the town of
St. Edmund received the name and liberty of a borough, the men of
every house used to give to the cellarer one penny in the beginning of
August, to reap our corn, which annual payment was called rep-silver.
Before the town became free, all of them used to reap as serfs; the
dwellings of knights and chaplains, and of the servants of the court
lodge being alone exempt from this payment. In process of time, the
cellarer spared certain of the most wealthy of the town, demanding
nothing from them. The other burgesses, seeing this, used openly to
say that no one who had a dwelling house of his own was liable to pay
this penny, but only those who rented houses from others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_151" id="page_151">{151}</a></span>
Afterwards, they all in common sought this exemption, conferring
thereon with the lord abbot, and offering an annual rent as a
composition of this demand. The abbot, indeed, considering the
undignified way in which the cellarer used to go through the town to
collect rep-silver, and the manner in which he used to take distresses
in the houses of the poor, sometimes taking trivets, sometimes doors,
and sometimes other utensils, and how the old women came out with
their distaffs, threatening and abusing the cellarer and his men,
ordered that twenty shillings should be given every year to the
cellarer at the next portman-moot, at the hand of the bailiff before
August, by the burgesses, who were to pay the rent to discharge this.
And it was done accordingly, and confirmed by our charter, there being
given to them another quittance from a certain customary payment,
which is called sorpeni, in consideration of four shillings, payable
at the same term. For the cellarer was accustomed to receive one penny
by the year for every cow belonging to the men of the town for their
dung and pasture (unless perchance they happened to be the cows of the
chaplains or of the servants at the court lodge). These cows he used
to impound, and had great trouble in the matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_152" id="page_152">{152}</a></span>
Afterwards, indeed, when the abbot made mention of this in the
chapter, the convent was very angry, and took it in ill part, so much
so that Benedict the sub-prior in the chapter, answering for all,
said, "That man, abbot Ording, who lies there, would not have done
such a thing for five hundred marks of silver." The abbot, although he
himself felt angry, put off the matter for a time.</p>

<p>There arose also a great contention between Roger the cellarer and
Hugh the sacrist concerning the appurtenances of their offices, so
that the sacrist would not lend to the cellarer the prison of the town
for the purpose of detaining therein the thieves who were taken in the
cellarer's jurisdiction. The cellarer was thereby oftentimes harassed,
and because the thieves escaped he was reprimanded for default of
justice.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that one holding as a free tenant of the
cellarer, dwelling without the gate, by name Ketel, was charged with
theft, and being vanquished in a trial by battle, was hanged. The
convent was grieved by the offensive words of the burgesses, who said
that if that man had only dwelt within the borough, it would not have
come to the ordeal, but that he would have acquitted himself by the
oaths of his neighbours, as is the privilege of those who dwell <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_153" id="page_153">{153}</a></span> within the
borough. Therefore the abbot and the more reasonable part of the
convent seeing this, and bearing in mind that the men without the
borough as well as those within are ours, and ought all of them in
like manner to enjoy the same liberty within the jurisdiction, except
the villeins of Hardwick and their like, deliberately took thought
with themselves how this could be done.</p>

<p>Thereupon the abbot, being desirous of limiting the offices of the
sacristy and the cellary by certain articles, and of quieting all
contentions, commanded, as if taking the part of the sacrist, that the
servants of the town bailiff and the servants of the cellarer should
together enter upon the fee of the cellarer for the purpose of seizing
thieves and malefactors, and that the bailiff should have half the
profit for their imprisonment and safe keeping and for his pains
therein; and that the court of the cellarer should go to the
portman-moot, and judge the prisoners in common. It was also ordered
that the men of the cellarer should come to the toll-house with the
others, and there renew their pledges, and should be inscribed upon
the bailiff's roll, and should there give the bailiff that penny which
is called borth-selver, whereof the cellarer was to have one half
part; but <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_154"
id="page_154">{154}</a></span> at this time the cellarer receives nothing
at all from this. The intent of all this was, that every one should
enjoy equal privilege. Nevertheless, the burgesses at this time say,
that the dwellers in the outskirts ought not to be quit of toll in
market, unless they belong to the merchant's guild. Moreover, the
bailiff (the abbot conniving at the matter) now claims for himself the
fines and forfeitures accruing from the fee of the cellarer.</p>

<p>The ancient customs of the cellarer, which we have seen, were
these: The cellarer had his messuage and barns near Scurun's well, at
which place he was accustomed to exercise his jurisdiction upon
robbers, and hold his court for all pleas and plaints. Also at that
place he was accustomed to put his men in pledge, and to enroll them
and to renew their pledges every year, and to take such profit
therefor as the bailiff of the town was to take at the portman-moot.
This messuage, with the adjacent garden, now in the occupation of the
infirmarer, was the mansion of Beodric, who was of old time the lord
of this town, and after whom also the town came to be called
Beodricsworth. His demesne lands are now in the demesne of the
cellarer, and that which is now called averland was the land <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_155" id="page_155">{155}</a></span> of his
rustics. And the total amount of the holding of himself and his churls
was thirty times thirty acres of land, which are still the fields of
this town.</p>

<p>The service thereof, when the town was made free, was divided into
two parts, so that the sacrist or town bailiff was to receive a free
annual payment, namely, for each acre twopence. The cellarer was to
have the ploughings and other services, namely, the ploughing of one
rood for each acre, without meals (which custom is still observed),
and was to have the folds wherein all the men of the town, except the
steward, who has his own fold, are bound to put their sheep (which
custom also is still observed); and was to have aver-peni, namely, for
each thirty acres twopence (which custom was done away with before the
decease of abbot Hugh, when Gilbert of Elveden was cellarer).</p>

<p>Furthermore, the men of the town were wont upon the order of the
cellarer to go to Lakenheath, and bring back a day's catch of eels
from Southrey. They often, indeed, used to return empty-handed, so
they had their trouble without any profit to the cellarer. It was
therefore settled between them that each thirty acres, from
thenceforth, should pay one penny by the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_156" id="page_156">{156}</a></span> year, and the men were to
remain at home. But, in fact, at this time, those lands are subdivided
into so many parts, that it can hardly be ascertained by whom that
annual payment is to be made; so that I have seen the cellarer, in one
year, receive twenty-seven pence, but now he can hardly get tenpence
halfpenny.</p>

<p>The cellarer was also wont to exercise authority over the ways
without the town, so that it was not lawful for any one to dig for
chalk or clay without his licence. He also was accustomed to summon
the fullers of the town, that they should furnish cloth for his salt.
Otherwise he would prohibit them the use of the waters, and would
seize the webs he found there; which customs are still observed. Also,
whosoever bought corn, or indeed anything from the cellarer, was
accustomed to be quit from toll at the gate of the town when he went
homewards, wherefore the cellarer sold his produce dearer; which usage
is still observed. Also, the cellarer is accustomed to take toll of
flax at the time of its carrying, namely, one truss from each load.
Also, the cellarer alone ought, or at least used to have, a free bull
in the fields of the town; now many persons have bulls.</p>

<p>Also, when any one surrendered his burgage land in <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_157" id="page_157">{157}</a></span> alms to the
convent, and this was assigned to the cellarer, or other official,
that land used, thenceforth, to be quit of haggovele, and most
especially so to the cellarer, on account of the dignity of his
office, for he is the second father in the monastery, or even as a
matter of reverence to the convent, for the estate of those who
procure our provisions ought to be favourable. But the abbot says that
usage is unjust, because the sacrist loses his service. Further, the
cellarer was accustomed to warrant to the servants of the court lodge,
that they should be quit of scot and tallage; but now it is not so,
for the burgesses say that the servants of the court lodge ought to be
quit only so far as they are servants, but not when they hold burgage
in the town, and when they or their wives publicly buy and sell in the
market.</p>

<p>Also, the cellarer was used freely to take all the dunghills in the
street, for his own use, unless it were before the doors of those who
were holding averland; for to them only was it allowable to collect
dung, and to keep it. This custom gradually lapsed in the time of
abbot Hugh until Dennis and Roger of Hingham became cellarers. Being
desirous of reviving the ancient custom, they took the cars of the
burgesses laden with dung, and made them unload; but a <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_158" id="page_158">{158}</a></span> multitude
of the burgesses resisting, and being too strong for them, every one
in his own tenement now collects his dung in a heap, and the poor sell
theirs when and to whom they choose.</p>

<p>The cellarer was also wont to have this privilege in the market of
this town, that he and his purveyors should have pre-emption of all
the provisions for the use of the convent, if the abbot were not at
home. Also, that the purveyors of the abbot, or cellarer, whichever of
them first came into the market, should buy first, either the latter
without the former, or the former without the latter. But if both were
present, then preference was to be given to the abbot. Also, in the
season when herrings were sold, the purveyors of the abbot should
always buy a hundred herrings at a halfpenny less than other people,
and likewise the cellarer and his purveyors. Also, if a load of fish
or other provisions should come first into the court lodge, or into
the market, and that load should not have been discharged from the
horse or from the cart, the cellarer or his purveyors might buy the
whole and take it home with them without paying toll. But the abbot
Samson commanded his purveyors that they should give preference to the
cellarer and his men, because, as he himself said, he had much <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_159" id="page_159">{159}</a></span> rather
himself go without than his convent. Therefore the purveyors, "in
honour preferring one another," if they find there is any one thing to
be bought which is not enough for both parties, buy it between them,
and divide it, share and share alike, and so between the head and the
members, and the father and the sons, there remains an agreement in
disagreement.</p>

<p>The poet has said, "Envy aims at the highest," and it is for this
reason that I repeat these words, that when some one was perusing this
narrative, and while he was reading of so many good acts, he called me
a flatterer of the abbot, and a seeker of favour and grace, saying
that I had silently suppressed some things which ought not to have
been passed by.</p>

<p>When I inquired which and what sort of acts they might be, he
answered, "Do you not see how the abbot grants away, at his own good
pleasure, the escheats of land belonging to the demesnes of the
convent, and the female heirs of lands, and the widows, as well within
the town of St. Edmund as without? Also, do you not see how the abbot
draws to himself the plaints and pleas of those who demand by the
King's writ lands which are of the fee of the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_160" id="page_160">{160}</a></span> convent, and especially
those plaints from which profit arises; and those from which no gain
ensues, he turns over to the cellarer or sacrist, or other officials?"
Whereto I answered, as I believe the fact to be, perhaps rightly,
perhaps wrongly, and said that every lord of a fee whereto there is
homage, ought by right to have an escheat whenever it shall have
fallen within the fee in respect whereof he has received homage. By
parity of reason, there is due to him general aid of the burgesses,
and also the wardships of boys, and the gifts of widows and girls, in
those fees in respect whereof he has received homage; for all these
things seem to belong to the abbot alone, unless by chance the abbey
shall be vacant.</p>

<p>Moreover, in the town of St. Edmund a special custom has place, by
reason of its being a borough, that the next in blood shall have the
wardship of a boy with an inheritance, until the years of discretion.
Furthermore, I thus answered him concerning the plaints and pleas,
that I had never seen the abbot usurp jurisdiction that belonged to
us, unless in default of our administering justice; but nevertheless,
he had on some occasions taken money, in order that by the
intervention of his authority plaints and pleas <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_161" id="page_161">{161}</a></span> should attain their final
determination. Also, I have sometimes seen pleas which belonged to us
decided in the court of the abbot, because there was not any in the
commencement of the suit who would, on the part of the convent, assert
jurisdiction.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smcap">the shrine of st. edmund</span></h2>


<p class="nodent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the year of grace
one thousand one hundred and ninety-eight, the glorious martyr Edmund
was pleased to strike terror into our convent, and to instruct us that
his body should be kept more reverently and diligently than it had
hitherto been.</p>

<p>There was a wooden platform between the shrine and the high altar,
whereon stood two tapers, which the keepers of the shrine used to
renew and stick together, by placing one candle upon the stump of
another in a slovenly manner. Under this platform there were many
things irreverently huddled together, such as flax and thread and wax,
and various utensils. In fact, whatever was used by the keepers of the
shrine was put there, for there was a door with iron gratings.</p>

<p>Now, when these keepers of the shrine were fast asleep, on the
night of St. Etheldreda, part of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_163"
id="page_163">{163}</a></span> a candle that had been renewed, and was
still burning, fell, as we conjecture, upon the aforesaid platform
covered with rags. Consequently, all that was near, above or below,
began to burn rapidly, so much so that the iron gratings were at a
white heat. And lo! the wrath of the Lord was kindled, but not without
mercy, according to that saying, "In wrath remember mercy"; for just
then the clock struck before the hour of matins, and the master of the
vestry getting up, observed and noticed the fire. He ran at once, and,
striking the gong as if for a dead person, cried at the top of his
voice that the shrine was consumed by fire.</p>

<p>We then, all running thither, found the fire raging wonderfully,
and encircling the whole shrine, and almost reaching the woodwork of
the church. Our young men, running for water, some to the well, some
to the clock, some with their hoods, not without great labour,
extinguished the force of the fire, and also stripped some of the
altars upon the first alarm. And when cold water was poured upon the
front of the shrine, the stones fell, and were reduced almost to
powder. Moreover, the nails by which the plates of silver were affixed
to the shrine started from the wood, which had been burnt underneath
to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_164" id="page_164">{164}</a></span>
the thickness of my finger, and the plates of silver were left
dangling one from the other without nails. However, the golden image
of the Majesty in front of the shrine, together with some of the
stonework, remained firm and untouched, and brighter after the fire
than it was before, for it was all of gold.</p>

<p>It so happened, by the will of the Highest, that at that time the
great beam which used to be over the altar had been removed, in order
to be adorned with new carving. It also happened that the cross, the
small image of St. Mary and St. John, the chest with the shirt of St.
Edmund, and the reliquaries and other shrines which used to hang from
the same beam, and other holy things which also stood upon the beam,
had every one of them been previously taken away. Otherwise all these
would have been burnt, as we believe, even as a painted cloth was
burnt which hung in the place of this beam. But what would it have
been had the church been curtained?</p>

<p>When, therefore, we had assured ourselves that the fire had in no
place penetrated the shrine, by carefully inspecting the chinks and
crannies, if there were any, and had perceived that all was cold, our
grief in a great measure abated: but all at once some of our brethren
cried out with a great wailing, that the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_165" id="page_165">{165}</a></span> cup of St. Edmund had been
burnt. When many of us were searching here and there for the stones
and plates among the coals and cinders, they drew forth the cup
entirely uninjured, lying in the middle of the great charred timbers,
which were then put out, and found the same wrapped up in a linen
cloth, half burnt. But the oaken box in which the cup was usually
placed had been burnt to ashes, and only the iron bands and iron lock
were found. When we saw this miracle, we all wept for joy.</p>

<p>Now, as we observed that the greater part of the front of the
shrine was stripped off, and abhorring the disgraceful circumstances
of the fire, after a general consultation we sent for a goldsmith, and
caused the metal plates to be joined together and fixed to the shrine
without the least delay, to avoid the scandal of the matter. We also
caused all traces of the fire to be covered over with wax or in some
other way. But the Evangelist testifies that "there is nothing covered
which shall not be revealed": for some pilgrims came very early in the
morning to make their offerings, who could have perceived nothing of
the sort. Nevertheless, certain of them, peering about, inquired where
was the fire that they had just heard had been about the shrine. <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_166" id="page_166">{166}</a></span> And since
it could not be entirely concealed, it was answered to these inquirers
that a candle had fallen down and that three napkins had been burnt,
and that by the heat of the fire some of the stonework in front of the
shrine had been destroyed. Yet for all this there went forth a lying
rumour, that the head of the saint had been burnt. Some indeed
contented themselves with saying that the hair only was singed; but
afterwards, the truth being known, "the mouth of them that spake lies
was stopped."</p>

<p>All these things came to pass by God's providence, in order that
the places round about the shrine of His saint should be more decently
kept, and that the purpose of the lord abbot should be sooner and
without delay carried into execution; which was, that the shrine
itself, together with the body of the holy martyr, should be placed
with greater security, and with more pomp, in a more dignified
position. For before this aforesaid mishap occurred, the cresting of
the shrine was half finished, and the marble blocks whereon the shrine
was to be elevated and was to rest, were for the most part ready and
polished.</p>

<p>The abbot, who at this time was absent, was exceedingly grieved at
these reports; and he on his return home, going into the
chapter-house, declared <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_167"
id="page_167">{167}</a></span> that these and the like, nay, much greater
perils might befall us for our sins, more especially for our grumbling
about our meat and drink; in a certain measure turning the blame upon
the whole body of the convent, rather than upon the avarice and
carelessness of the keepers of the shrine. To the intent that he might
induce us to abstain from our pittances for at least one year, and to
apply, for at least a year, the rents of the pittancy, for the purpose
of repairing the front of the shrine with pure gold, he himself first
showed us an example of liberality by giving all the treasure of gold
he possessed, namely, fifteen golden rings, worth, as it was believed,
sixty marks, in our presence, towards the reparation of the
shrine.</p>

<p>We, on the other hand, all agreed to give our pittancy for such
purpose; but our resolution was afterwards altered, by the sacrist
saying that St. Edmund could very well repair his shrine without such
assistance.</p>

<p>At this time there came a man of great account, but who he was I
know not, that related to the abbot a vision he had seen, whereat he
himself was much moved. Indeed, he related the same in full chapter,
with a very bitter speech. "It is indeed true," he <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_168" id="page_168">{168}</a></span> said, "that
a certain great man has seen a vision, to wit, that he saw the holy
martyr St. Edmund lie outside his shrine, and with groans say that he
was despoiled of his clothes, and was wasted away by hunger and
thirst; and that his churchyard and the courts of his church were
negligently kept."</p>

<p>This dream the abbot expounded to us all publicly, laying the blame
upon us, in this fashion: "St. Edmund alleges that he is naked,
because you defraud the naked poor of your old clothes, and because
you give with reluctance what you are bound to give them, and it is
the same with your meat and drink. Moreover, the idleness and
negligence of the sacrist and his associates, are apparent from the
recent misfortune by fire which has taken place between the shrine and
the altar." On hearing this the convent was very sorrowful; and after
chapter several of the brethren met together, and interpreted the
dream after this fashion: "We," said they, "are the naked members of
St. Edmund, and the convent is his naked body; for we are despoiled of
our ancient customs and privileges. The abbot has everything, the
chamberlainship, the sacristy, the cellary; while we perish of hunger
and thirst, because we have not our victuals, save by the clerk of the
abbot and by his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_169"
id="page_169">{169}</a></span> ministration. If the keepers of the shrine
have been negligent, let the abbot lay it to his own charge, for it
was he who appointed such careless fellows."</p>

<p>In such wise spoke many in the convent. But when this
interpretation of the dream was communicated to the abbot, in the
forest of Harlow, on his way from London, he was very wroth, and was
troubled in mind, and made answer: "They will wrest that dream against
me, will they? By the face of God! so soon as I reach home I will
restore to them the customs that they say are theirs. I will withdraw
my clerk from the cellary, and will leave them to themselves; and I
shall see the fruits of their wisdom at the end of the year. This year
I have been residing at home, and I have caused their cellary to be
managed without incurring debt; and this is the way in which they
render me thanks."</p>

<p>On the abbot's return home, having it in purpose to translate the
blessed martyr, he humbled himself before God and man, meditating
within himself how he might reform himself, and make himself at peace
with all men, especially with his own convent. Therefore, sitting in
chapter, he commanded that a cellarer and sub-cellarer should be
chosen by our common assent, and withdrew his own clerk, saying, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_170" id="page_170">{170}</a></span> that
whatsoever he had done he had done it for our advantage, as he called
God and his saints to witness, and justified himself in various
ways.</p>

<p>"Hear, O Heaven!" the things that I speak; "give ear, O earth!" to
what Abbot Samson did. The feast of St. Edmund now approaching, the
marble blocks were polished, and everything made ready for the
elevation of the shrine. The feast day having therefore been kept on a
Friday, a three days' fast was proclaimed on the following Sunday to
the people, and the occasion of the fast was publicly explained. The
abbot also announced to the convent that they should prepare
themselves for transferring the shrine, and placing it upon the high
altar, until the masons' work was finished; and he appointed the time
and the manner for doing this work.</p>

<p>When we had that night come to matins, there stood the great shrine
upon the altar, empty within, adorned with white doeskins above,
below, and round about, which were fixed to the wood by silver nails;
but one panel stood below, by a column of the church, and the sacred
body still lay in its accustomed place. Lauds having been sung, we all
proceeded to take our disciplines. This being performed, the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_171" id="page_171">{171}</a></span> lord abbot
and those with him vested themselves in albs; and approaching
reverently, as it was fit they should, they hastened to uncover the
coffin.</p>

<p>First there was an outer cloth of linen, overwrapping the coffin
and all. This was found tied on the upper side with strings of its
own. Within this was a cloth of silk, and then another linen cloth,
and then a third. And so at last the coffin was uncovered, standing
upon a tray of wood, that the bottom of it might not be injured by the
stone.</p>

<p>Affixed to the outside, over the breast of the martyr, lay an angel
of gold, about the length of a man's foot, holding in one hand a
golden sword and in the other a banner. Underneath it, there was a
hole in the lid of the coffin, where the ancient custodians of the
martyr had been wont to lay their hands, for the purpose of touching
the sacred body. And over the figure of the angel was this verse
inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Martiris ecce zoma servat Michaelis agalma."</p>

<p>("<i>Behold the martyr's body St. Michael's image keeps.</i>")</p>

<p>At the two heads of the coffin were iron rings, as there used to be
on Danish chests.</p>

<p>So, raising up the coffin with the body, they carried it to the
altar, and I lent thereto my sinful hand to help in carrying it,
although the abbot had <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_172"
id="page_172">{172}</a></span> strictly commanded that no one should
approach unless he was called. The coffin was placed within the
shrine, and the panel was put thereon and fastened down.</p>

<p>Now we all began to think that the abbot would exhibit the coffin
to the people on the octave of the feast, and would replace the sacred
body before all of us. But we were sadly deceived, as the sequel will
show; for on Wednesday, while the convent was singing compline, the
abbot spoke with the sacrist and Walter the physician, and it was
resolved that twelve brethren should be appointed who were strong
enough to carry the panels of the shrine, and skilful in fixing and
unfixing them.</p>

<p>The abbot then said that it had been the object of his prayers to
see his patron saint, and that he wished to join with him the sacrist
and Walter the physician when he looked upon him; and there were also
nominated the abbot's two chaplains, the two keepers of the shrine,
and the two keepers of the vestry, with six others, Hugh the sacrist,
Walter the physician, Augustine, William of Diss, Robert and Richard.
The convent being all asleep, these twelve vested themselves in albs,
and drawing the coffin out of the shrine, carried and placed it upon a
table near <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_173"
id="page_173">{173}</a></span> where the shrine used to be, and commenced
unfastening the lid, which was joined and fixed to the coffin with
sixteen very long iron nails. When, with considerable difficulty, they
had performed this, all were ordered to go further away, except the
two forenamed associates.</p>

<p>Now the coffin was so filled with the sacred body, both in length
and width, that even a needle could hardly be put between the head and
the wood or between the feet and the wood. The head lay united to the
body, somewhat raised by a small pillow. The abbot, looking
attentively, next found a silk cloth veiling the whole body, and then
a linen cloth of wondrous whiteness, and upon the head a small linen
cloth, and after that another small and very fine silken cloth, as if
it had been the veil of some nun. Lastly, they discovered the body,
wound round with a linen cloth, and then it was that all the
lineaments of the saint's body were laid open to view.</p>

<p>At this point the abbot stopped, saying he durst not proceed
further, or view the holy body naked. Taking the head between his
hands, he sighed and spoke thus: "Glorious martyr, St. Edmund, blessed
be the hour wherein thou wast born! Glorious <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_174" id="page_174">{174}</a></span> martyr, turn not my
boldness to my perdition, for that I, miserable sinner, do touch thee,
for thou knowest my devotion and my intention!" And proceeding, he
touched the eyes and the nose, which was very massive and prominent.
Then he touched the breast and arms, and raising the left arm, he
touched the fingers, and placed his own fingers between the fingers of
the saint. Proceeding further, he found the feet standing stiff up,
like the feet of a man who had died that day, and he touched the toes,
and in touching counted them.</p>

<p>It was then proposed that the other brethren should be called
forward, in order that they might see these wonders; and six, being
thus called, approached, and also six other brethren with them, who
had stolen in without the abbot's assent, and saw the saint's body,
namely, Walter of St. Alban's, Hugh the infirmarer, Gilbert the
brother of the prior, Richard of Hingham, Jocell the cellarer, and
Thurstan the little, who alone put forth his hand, and touched the
feet and knees of the saint. And the Most High so ordering it, that
there might be abundance of witnesses, one of our brethren, John of
Diss, sitting upon the roof of the church with the servants of the
vestry, saw all these things plainly enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_175" id="page_175">{175}</a></span>
All this being done, the lid was fastened down on the coffin with the
same, and with the same number of nails, and in like manner as before,
the martyr being covered up with the same cloths and in the same order
as he was when first discovered. Finally, the coffin was placed in the
accustomed place, and there was put upon the coffin, near to the
angel, a certain silken bag, wherein was deposited a schedule written
in English, containing certain salutations of Ailwin the monk, as is
believed, which schedule was found close by the golden angel when the
coffin was uncovered. By the abbot's order, there was forthwith
written another short memorandum, also deposited in the same bag, in
the following form of words: "In the year of the incarnation of our
Lord, 1198, the abbot Samson, upon the impulse of devotion, saw and
touched the body of St. Edmund on the night after the feast of St.
Catherine, these being witnesses." And thereto were subscribed the
names of the eighteen monks.</p>

<p>The brethren also wound the whole coffin up in a suitable linen
cloth, and over the same placed a new and most valuable silken cloth,
which Hubert, Archbishop of Canterbury, had offered at the shrine that
very year, and they placed lengthwise <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_176" id="page_176">{176}</a></span> a certain linen cloth
doubled under it and next to the stone, to prevent the coffin or the
tray whereon it stood from being injured by the stone. Afterwards the
panels were brought forth, and properly joined together on the
shrine.</p>

<p>When the convent assembled to sing matins, and understood what had
been done, all who had not seen these things were very sorrowful,
saying among themselves, "We have been sadly deceived." However, after
matins had been sung, the abbot called the convent to the high altar,
and briefly recounting what had been done, alleged that he ought not
to call&mdash;and could not call&mdash;all of them to be present on such an
occasion. Hearing this, with tears we sang "Te Deum laudamus," and
hastened to ring the bells in the choir.</p>

<p>On the fourth day after, the abbot deposed the keepers of the
shrine and the keeper of St. Botolph, appointing new ones, and
establishing rules, so that the holy places should be more carefully
and diligently kept. He also caused the great altar, which heretofore
was hollow, and wherein many things were irreverently stowed away, and
that space which was between the shrine and the altar, to be made
solid with stone and cement, so that no danger from <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_177" id="page_177">{177}</a></span> fire could
arise by the negligence of the keepers, as had been already the case;
according to the saying of the wise man, who said,</p>

<p>"Happy is he who learns caution from the danger of others."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_178" id="page_178">{178}</a></span><br /></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="smcap">the monastery in revolt</span></h2>


<p class="nodent"><span class="dropcap">N</span>OW when the abbot had
obtained the favour and grace of King Richard by gifts and money, so
that he had good reason to believe that he could succeed according to
his desire in all his undertakings, the King died, and the abbot lost
his labour and outlay. However, King John, immediately after his
coronation, setting aside all other affairs, came down to St. Edmund,
drawn thither by his vow and by devotion. We, indeed, believed that he
was come to make offering of some great matter; but all he offered was
one silken cloth, which his servants had borrowed from our sacrist,
and to this day have not paid for. He availed himself of the
hospitality of St. Edmund, which was attended with enormous expense,
and upon his departure bestowed nothing at all, either of honour or
profit, upon the saint, save thirteen pence sterling, which he offered
at his mass on the day of his departure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_179" id="page_179">{179}</a></span>
About that time some of our officials made complaint, stating in our
chapter that Ralph the porter, our servant, maintained causes and
actions against them to the damage of the church and to the prejudice
of the convent. It was ordered by the prior, with the assent of us
all, that he should be punished according to the custom whereby our
servants are usually punished, that is, by the withholding of their
stipends. It was therefore ordered that the cellarer should withhold
from him, not the corody which of right belonged to his office
according to the tenour of his charter, but certain additions and
perquisites which the cellarer and sub-cellarer allowed him without
knowledge of the convent at large. Now the aforesaid Ralph,
accompanied by certain of the abbot's table, complained to the abbot
on his return from London, that the prior and convent had disseised
him of his corody, whereof he was seised when the abbot had first come
to the abbacy. They also stated to the abbot that this act was done
without his sanction, and to his dishonour, and unreasonably, without
his advice, and without investigation. The abbot indeed believed him,
and, in other wise than was either fitting or customary, became
excited. He instantly justified Ralph, and affirmed that he was <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_180" id="page_180">{180}</a></span> innocent.
Coming into chapter and complaining thereof, he said that what had
been done was to his prejudice and without his consent. And it was
answered by one of us, the others all joining him, that this was done
by the prior, and with the assent of the whole convent.</p>

<p>The abbot was confused at this, saying, "I have nourished and
brought up children, and they have rebelled against me." Not
overlooking this (as he ought to have done) for the sake of peace to
the many, but rather exhibiting his power with a resolution not to be
over-mastered, he openly gave command to the cellarer that he should
restore to Ralph, fully and wholly, all that had been taken from him,
and that he should drink nothing but water till he had restored
everything. But Jocell the cellarer, hearing this, chose for that day
to drink water, rather than restore the corody to Ralph against the
will of the convent. When this came to the abbot's knowledge on the
morrow, he forbade both meat and drink to the cellarer until he
restored all. With these words the abbot immediately departed from the
town, and stayed away for eight days.</p>

<p>On the same day on which the abbot had departed, <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_181" id="page_181">{181}</a></span> the
cellarer arose in chapter, and exhibiting the precept of the abbot,
and holding his keys in his hand, said that he had rather be deposed
from his office than do anything in opposition to the convent. And
then there began a great tumult in the convent, such as I had never
before seen; and they said that the precept of the abbot was not to be
obeyed. But the seniors and more prudent men of the convent,
discreetly holding their tongues, upon being urged gave it as their
opinion that the abbot was to be obeyed in everything, except in
things manifestly against God's pleasure; and intimated that we must
bear with this scandalous behaviour for a time for the sake of peace,
lest worse should befall. Now when the prior had begun to sing "Verba
mea" for all deceased, as is the rule, the novices withstood him, and
with them nearly the half of the convent; and raising their voices,
they all cried out in answer, and opposed it. Nevertheless, the senior
part of the convent prevailed, although they were few as compared with
the rest.</p>

<p>The abbot, although absent, yet by his messengers terrified some by
threats. Some others he drew over to him by fair words; and the more
influential men of the convent, as though they were afraid even of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_182" id="page_182">{182}</a></span>
garment, he caused to secede from the counsel of the generality, that
that gospel should be fulfilled which says, "Every kingdom divided
against itself is brought to desolation." Moreover, the abbot said
that he would by no means come amongst us, by reason of the
conspiracies and oaths which, as he said, we had made against him,
that we should kill him with our knives. However, returning home, and
sitting in his inner chamber, he gave orders to one of our brethren
whom he vehemently suspected, that he should come to him; and because
he would not come, fearing to be taken and bound, he was
excommunicated; and the whole day after he was put into fetters,
remaining till morning in the infirmary. Three others the abbot also
included in a lighter sentence, in order that the others might
fear.</p>

<p>On the morrow it was resolved that the abbot should be sent for,
and that we should humble ourselves before him, both in word and
demeanour, so that his anger might be appeased; and it was done
accordingly. He, on the other hand, answering meekly enough, but
always alleging his own rectitude, laid the blame upon us. Yet when he
saw that we were willing to be overcome, was himself fairly overcome.
Bursting into tears, he swore that he had never <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_183" id="page_183">{183}</a></span> grieved for any one thing
as he had upon the present occasion, as well on his own account as on
our account also, and more especially for the scandal, the evil report
which had already gone abroad concerning our dissension, to the effect
that the monks of St. Edmund wished to kill their abbot.</p>

<p>And when the abbot had told us how he went away on purpose till his
anger had cooled, repeating this saying of the philosopher, "I would
have taken vengeance upon thee had I not been angry," he arose,
weeping, and embraced all and every one of us with the kiss of peace.
He wept, and we also wept. The brethren who had been excommunicated
were immediately absolved; and thus "the tempest ceased, and there was
a great calm." Yet for all this the abbot gave private orders that the
accustomed corody should be given without stint to Ralph the porter,
as heretofore; to which matter, however, we shut our eyes, being at
last made to understand that there is no lord who will not bear rule,
and that battle is perilous which is undertaken against the stronger,
and is begun against the more powerful party.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_186" id="page_186">{186}</a></span></p>

<p>Now Geoffrey Ruffus, one of our monks, although he deported himself
in somewhat too secular a manner, yet was a useful person to us in the
keeping of the four manors of Barton, Pakenham, Rougham, and
Bradfield, where there had often been heretofore a deficiency in the
farms. But the abbot, although hearing of the evil report of his
continence, yet winked at it for a long time, most likely because
Geoffrey seemed to be serviceable to the community. At length, when
the truth was known, the abbot suddenly made a seizure of his chests,
put them in the vestry, and caused all the stock of the different
manors to be kept most closely, and remanded Geoffrey to the cloister.
There was found much gold and silver, to the value of two hundred
marks, the whole of which the abbot said was to be laid by for the
purpose of making the front of the shrine of St. Edmund.</p>

<p>On the feast of St. Michael it was decreed in chapter that two
brethren, not one alone, should succeed to the keepership of the
manors, whereof one was Roger of Hingham, who promised before us all
that he was willing and able to undertake the charge of the manors and
cellary together. The abbot gave his assent thereto, but the convent
was reluctant. And Jocell, who had well and carefully managed his
office, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_187"
id="page_187">{187}</a></span> and for two years had been in charge of the
cellary without incurring debt, as other cellarers had used to do, was
deposed from the cellary and was made sub-cellarer. But at the end of
the year, Roger, on rendering account of his receipts and outgoings,
affirmed that he had received sixty marks from the stock of the manors
to supply the deficiency of the cellarer. Therefore, upon counsel
being taken, it was resolved that Jocell should be restored to the
cellary; and Mildenhall and Chebenhall and Southwold were granted to
him. The other manors were committed to Roger and Albin, and were
divided from the cellary, lest the manors should be ruined by the
cellary, or the cellary be ruined by the manors.</p>

<p>Adam of Cockfield being dead, the abbot could have had three
hundred marks for the wardship of the only daughter of the same Adam;
but because the grandfather of the damsel had taken her away privily,
and inasmuch as the abbot was not able to obtain seisin of the damsel,
unless by the aid of the archbishop, the abbot granted that wardship
to Hubert, Archbishop of Canterbury, for the consideration of one
hundred pounds. The archbishop, for five hundred marks, granted to
Thomas de Burgh, the brother of the King's chamberlain, that same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_188" id="page_188">{188}</a></span>
wardship; and the damsel was delivered to him, with her rights, by the
hand of the abbot. Thomas, therefore, at once required the seisin of
these manors, which we had in our hands after the death of
Adam&mdash;Cockfield, Semer, and Groton&mdash;we believing that we had power to
retain all of them in our demesne, or at least two of them, Semer and
Groton; both because Robert of Cockfield, being on his deathbed, had
publicly affirmed that he could claim nothing by right of inheritance
in these two manors, and also because Adam, his son, had re-assigned
to us those two manors in full court, and had made his charter
thereof, wherein it was contained that he holds those two manors by
the permission of the convent during his life only.</p>

<p>Thomas, therefore, suing a writ of recognition thereof, caused the
knights to be summoned, that they should come to be sworn before the
King at Tewkesbury. Our charter read in public had no force, for the
whole court was against us. The oath being administered, the knights
said that they knew nothing about our charters, or of any private
agreements; but this they said they did believe, that Adam and his
father and his grandfather, for a hundred years back, had holden the
manors in fee-farm, one after the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_189" id="page_189">{189}</a></span> other, on the days of their
respective deaths. Thus we were disseised by the judgment of the
court, after much trouble and many charges expended, saving
nevertheless our ancient fee-farm rents payable annually.</p>

<p>The lord abbot seemed to be "misled by a certain appearance of
right," because, forsooth, the Scripture saith, "I will not give my
glory to another." The abbot of Cluny coming to us, and received by us
in such wise as he ought, our abbot would not give place, either in
chapter or in the procession on Sunday, but he must needs sit and
stand in the middle between the abbot of Cluny and the abbot of
Chertsey. Wherefore divers thought different things, and many
expressed their feelings in various ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_190" id="page_190">{190}</a></span><br /></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smcap">the election of a new prior</span></h2>


<p class="nodent"><span class="dropcap">R</span>OBERT the prior was at
this time in a dying state; but while he was yet alive many opinions
were uttered as to appointing a new prior. Some one, therefore,
related to us, that the abbot sitting in the choir, and steadfastly
beholding all the brethren from the first to the last, found no one
upon whom his spirit might rest to make him prior, save Herbert his
chaplain. By these and similar acts the will of the abbot was made
apparent to most of us. One of us hearing this, answered that it was
not to be believed; asserting "that the abbot, a diligent and prudent
man, to such a man, a youth and almost beardless novice of twelve
years, who had only become a cloister monk four years ago, not
approved in the cure of souls, nor in doctrinal learning&mdash;to such a
one," said he, "he will never give the priorate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_191" id="page_191">{191}</a></span>
Now, when the prior died, the abbot was staying in London; and a
certain person said, "A month has scarcely elapsed since the abbot
made Herbert the chaplain, sub-sacrist, and when he committed that
office to him, in the chapel of St. Nicasius, he promised that if he
could, by any means, make him prior, he would use his utmost exertions
on his behalf." Some one hearing of this, who was desirous of making
himself agreeable to the abbot and the future prior, most urgently
solicited many of us, seniors and juniors alike, that when the
opportunity presented itself they would nominate Herbert, at least
with some others, for prior. He affirmed that by this means they would
gratify the abbot, for such indeed was his desire.</p>

<p>There certainly were many of us, as well of the seniors as the
juniors, who asserted that the same Herbert was an amiable and affable
man, and worthy of much honour. Also, there were some&mdash;few in number,
indeed, but whose advice was more respected, and who belonged to the
wiser part of the convent&mdash;who were desirous of promoting Master
Hermer the sub-prior to be prior, as being an experienced, learned and
eloquent man, skilful and expert in the cure of souls, who at that
time had governed the cloister for <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_192" id="page_192">{192}</a></span> fourteen years in good
discipline, an approved sub-prior, and well known. This man, I say,
they were desirous of preferring, according to that saying of the wise
man, "believe an experienced master."</p>

<p>But the greater number of us secretly grumbled in opposition,
saying that he was a passionate, impatient, restless, fussy and
fretful man, a litigious person, and a disturber of peace, deriding
him, and saying, "The discretion of a man deferreth his anger, and it
is his glory to pass over a transgression." Also, another one said,
"This one thing, as being a scandal, is to be much guarded against,
namely, that if the sub-prior be removed, henceforward learned clerks
will not deign to take on them the religious habit in our house, if it
should happen that any dumb image be set up, and a wooden log be
preferred in such a convent as ours." And the same brother added
somewhat more, saying that a person to be prior of our convent, should
be such a one that if any question of great importance arose in the
abbot's absence concerning ecclesiastical or secular affairs, it might
be referred to the prior, as being the highest and most discreet
person.</p>

<p>A certain one of our brethren, hearing these and such like things,
said, "What good is it that ye <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_193"
id="page_193">{193}</a></span> multiply so many and such sayings? When the
abbot comes home, he will do as he pleases about it. Perhaps he may
seek the advice of each of us singly, and with great show of
formality; but in the end, by allegations and by plausible reasonings
and circumlocutions, he will at last come down to the fulfilment of
his own desire; and the affair will end as he has all along
intended."</p>

<p>The abbot, therefore, having returned, and sitting in chapter, set
forth to us amply and eloquently enough what sort of man ought to be
appointed prior. John the third prior answered, in the presence of us
all, that the sub-prior was a worthy and fit person. But the greater
number immediately opposed, saying, "A man of peace, let a man of
peace be given us." Two of us, therefore, replied to them, saying that
a person should be appointed who knew how to direct the souls of men,
and to distinguish "between leprosy and leprosy," which saying gave
great offence, for it seemed to favour the part of the sub-prior. But
the abbot hearing this uproar, said that he would after chapter hear
what each had to say, and so proceed advisedly in the business, and
upon the morrow would dispatch it as he thought fit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_194" id="page_194">{194}</a></span> In
the meantime some one said that the abbot would go through this
formality in order that the sub-prior should be cautiously shelved
from the office of prior, as if it had been done by the advice of the
convent, not by the desire of the abbot; and so he, the abbot, would
be held excused, and by this policy the mouth of them that speak lies
should be stopped.</p>

<p>On the morrow the abbot, as he sat in chapter, wept sorely, saying
that he had passed the whole night without sleep, for sheer anxiety
and apprehension that he might chance to nominate one who was
displeasing to God. He swore upon peril of his soul that he would
nominate four of us who, according to his opinion, were most
serviceable and fit, so that we should choose one from those four.
Therefore the abbot, in the first place, named the sacrist, whom he
well knew to be infirm and insufficient, as the sacrist himself
testified with an oath. Forthwith, in the presence of all, he named
John the third prior, his cousin, and Maurice his chaplain, and the
before-named Herbert, all indeed young men, of about forty years old
or under, and all of them of moderate learning, and, so far as
respects the cure of souls, rather requiring to be taught than learned
therein, nevertheless apt to learn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_195" id="page_195">{195}</a></span>
These three the abbot nominated and preferred, passing over the
sub-prior, and passing by many others of the seniors and elders,
experienced and learned men, some who had formerly been masters of the
schools, as well as all others. The abbot dwelt long in speaking of
and commending the person of John in many respects; but, nevertheless,
on the other side, alleged that the great number of his relations in
this province would lie heavy on his neck if he were prior.</p>

<p>Now, when the abbot was about to allege the same thing concerning
Maurice (and he could with reason do it), so that in a roundabout way
he should come to make mention of Herbert, his discourse was
interrupted by one of the elders of the convent saying, "Master
precentor, you have the first voice; name Master Herbert." "He is a
good man," said he. On hearing the name of Herbert, the abbot stopped
speaking, and turning to the precentor, said, "I have no objection to
receive Herbert if you will." On this saying, the whole convent cried
out, "He is a good man; he is a good and amiable man"; and this same
thing also many of the elders testified. Immediately hereupon the
precentor and some one in alliance with him, and two others on the
other <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_196" id="page_196">{196}</a></span>
side, arose with all haste, and put Herbert in the midst.</p>

<p>Herbert, indeed, at first humbly begged to be excused, saying that
he was insufficient to fill such a dignity, and particularly, as he
said, he was not of such perfect knowledge that he should know how to
make a sermon in chapter in such manner as would become a prior. Most
of those who witnessed this were amazed, and for very confusion struck
dumb. However, the abbot said in answer many things to re-assure him,
and as it were in disparagement of learned men, saying that he could
well remember and con over the sermons of others, just as others did;
and began to condemn rhetorical flourishes, and pompous words, and
choice sentences, saying that in many churches the sermon in convent
is delivered in French, or rather in English, for moral edification,
not for literary ostentation.</p>

<p>After this had been said, the new prior advanced to the feet of the
abbot and kissed them. The abbot received him with tears, and with his
own hand placed him in the prior's seat, and commanded all that they
should pay him the reverence and obedience due to him as prior.</p>

<p>The chapter being over, I being hospitaller, sat in <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_197" id="page_197">{197}</a></span> the porch
of the guest-hall, stupefied, and revolving in my mind the things I
had heard and seen; and I began to consider closely for what cause and
for what particular merits such a man should be advanced to so high a
dignity. And I began to reflect that the man was of comely stature and
of striking appearance; handsome and pleasant looking; always
cheerful; of a smiling countenance, be it early or late; kind to all;
a man calm in his bearing, and grave in his gait; polite in speech,
possessing a sweet voice in chanting, and expressive in reading;
young, strong, of a healthy body, and always in readiness to undergo
travail for the needs of the church; skilful in conforming himself to
every circumstance of place or time, either with ecclesiastics, clerks
or seculars; liberal and social, and gentle in reproof; not spiteful,
not suspicious, not covetous, not tiresome, not slothful; sober and
fluent of tongue in the French idiom, as being a Norman by birth; a
man of moderate understanding, who, if "too much learning should make
him mad," might be said to be a perfectly accomplished man.</p>

<p>When I regarded these things I said in my mind, such a man would
become very popular, but "there is nothing every way blessed," and I
wept for joy, saying that "God hath visited his people; as the <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_198" id="page_198">{198}</a></span> Lord
pleased, so it hath been done." But of a sudden another thought
occurred to me: "Be cautious in your praise of a new man, for honours
alter manners, or rather they show them. Wait and see who and what
sort of men will be his counsellors, and to whom he will give ear, for
each thing naturally draws to its like. The event will prove his
doings, and therefore be sparing in your praises."</p>

<p>On the same day certain unlearned brethren, as well officials as
cloister-folk, came together, and "whetted their tongues like a sword
that they might shoot privily at" the learned, repeating the words of
the abbot, which he had that day spoken, as it were to the prejudice
of the learned. Thus they said to one another, "Now let our
philosophers take to their philosophies: now is it manifest what their
philosophies are worth. So often have our good clerks declined in the
cloister that they are now declined. So much have they sermonized in
chapter that all are driven away. So much have they spoken of
discerning between leprosy and leprosy that as lepers they are all put
out. So often have they declined <i>musa</i>, <i>musae</i>, that all
of them are reckoned musards" (drivellers). These and such like things
certain uttered in ridicule and scandal of others, justifying <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_199" id="page_199">{199}</a></span> their own
ignorance: they condemned the knowledge of polite learning, and
disparaged learned men, being very merry, and expecting great things,
which, in all probability, will never come to pass, for "Hope of good
is often deceived in its expectation."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="smcap">the abbot's foibles</span></h2>


<p class="nodent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE wise man hath said,
"No one is in every respect perfect"; nor was the abbot Samson. For
this reason let me say this, that according to my judgment the abbot
was not to be commended when he caused a deed to be made and ordered
the same to be delivered to a certain servant of his, for him to have
the sergeanty of John Ruffus, after the decease of the same John. Ten
marks, as it was said, "did blind the eyes of the wise." Wherefore,
upon Master Dennis, the monk, saying that such an act was unheard of,
the abbot replied: "I shall not cease from doing as I like a whit the
more for you than I would for that youngster." The abbot also did the
like thing in respect of the sergeanty of Adam the infirmarer, upon
payment of one hundred shillings. Of such an act it may be said, "A
little leaven leaveneth the whole lump."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_201" id="page_201">{201}</a></span>
There is, also, another stain of evil doing, which I trust in the Lord
he will wash away with tears, in order that a single excess may not
disfigure the sum total of so many good deeds. He built up the bank of
the fish-pond at Babwell so high, for the service of a new mill, that
by the keeping back of the water there is not a man, rich or poor, who
has land near the water, from the gate of the town to Eastgate, but
has lost his garden and his orchards. The pasture of the cellarer,
upon the other side of the bank, is spoilt. The arable land, also, of
the neighbouring folk has been much deteriorated. The meadow of the
cellarer is ruined, the orchard of the infirmarer has been flooded by
the great flow of water, and all the neighbouring folk are complaining
thereof. Once, indeed, the cellarer argued with him in full chapter,
upon this excessive damage; but he, quickly moved to anger, made
answer, that his fish-pond was not to be spoilt on account of our
meadows.</p>

<p>The Dean of London writes thus in his chronicles: "King Henry the
Second, having conferred with the archbishop and bishops concerning
the vacant abbacies, so far observed the rule of the canons in
appointing abbots, that it was the custom to appoint them upon votes
solicited from other houses; thinking, perhaps, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_202" id="page_202">{202}</a></span> that if pastors were set up
in every place from their own body," a previously contracted
familiarity would afford impunity to vice, and old acquaintanceship
would give indulgence to wickedness, and thereby too great remissness
would obtain in cloisters. Another has said: "It does not seem fit
that a pastor should be elected from his own house, but rather from
some other house; because, if he is taken from elsewhere he will
always believe, according to the greatness of the monastery which he
has undertaken to rule, that many are good men and true, whose advice
he will seek if he is a good man, and whose honesty he will fear if he
is a bad one. But a servant of the house, better knowing the
ignorance, inability and incompetence of every one, will the more
carelessly serve therein, mixing square with round."</p>

<p>The monks of Ramsey followed this line of reasoning; for in those
days, when they were able to choose one of their own body, on two
occasions they chose an abbot from other houses.</p>

<p>In the year of grace one thousand two hundred and one there came to
us the abbot of Flay, and through his preaching caused the open buying
and selling which took place in the market on Sundays to be done away
with, and it was ordained that the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_203" id="page_203">{203}</a></span> market should be held on
the Monday. The like the abbot brought to pass in many cities and
boroughs of England.</p>

<p>In the same year the monks of Ely set up a market at Lakenheath,
having the permission, as well as the charter, of the King. Now, we in
the first place, dealing peaceably with our friends and neighbours,
sent our messengers to the chapter of Ely, and, first of all, to the
lord Bishop of Ely, letters of request that he should forbear his
intentions; adding that we could, in a friendly way, for the sake of
peace and preserving our mutual regard, pay the fifteen marks that
were given as a fine for obtaining the King's charter. Why make a long
story of it? They would not give way, and then upon all sides arose
threatening speeches, and "spears threatening spears."</p>

<p>We therefore procured a writ of inquest to ascertain whether that
market was established to our prejudice, and to the damage of the
market of the town of St. Edmund. The oath was made, and it was
testified that this had been done to our damage. Of all which, when
the King was informed, he caused it to be inquired, by his registrar,
what sort of charter he had granted to the monks of Ely; and it was
made to appear that he had given to them the aforesaid <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_204" id="page_204">{204}</a></span> market,
under such conditions that it should not be to the injury of the
neighbouring markets. The King, therefore, forty marks being offered,
granted us his charter that from thenceforward there should be no
market within the liberty of St. Edmund, unless by the assent of the
abbot. And he wrote to Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, his justiciary, that the
market of Lakenheath should be abolished. The justiciary wrote the
same to the sheriff of Suffolk.</p>

<p>The sheriff, being well aware that he could not enter upon the
liberties of St. Edmund, or exercise any authority there, gave it in
charge to the abbot, by his writ, that this should be performed
according to the form of the royal command. The steward of the
hundred, therefore, coming thither upon the market day, with the
witnessing of freemen, in the King's name openly prohibited that
market, showing the letters of the King and the sheriff; but being
treated with great abuse and violence, he departed, without having
accomplished his object.</p>

<p>The abbot, on the other hand, deferring this matter for awhile,
being at London, and consulting the learned thereupon, commanded his
bailiffs, that taking with them the men of St. Edmund with horse and
arms, they should abolish the market, and that <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_205" id="page_205">{205}</a></span> they should bring along
with them in custody the buyers and sellers therein, if they should
find any. So at dead of night, there went forth nearly six hundred men
well armed, proceeding towards Lakenheath. But when the scouts gave
intelligence of their arrival, all who were in the market ran hither
and thither, and not one of them could be found.</p>

<p>Now, the prior of Ely on that same night had come thither, with his
bailiffs, expecting the arrival of our men, in order that, to the best
of his ability, he might defend the buyers and sellers; but he would
not stir out of his inn. When our bailiffs had required from him gage
and pledge to stand trial in the court of St. Edmund for the wrong
committed by him, and he had refused, upon consultation, they
overturned the butchers' shambles and the tables of the stalls in the
market, and carried them away with them. Moreover, they led away with
them all the cattle, "all sheep and oxen; yea, and the beasts of the
field," and set off towards Icklingham. The bailiffs of the prior
following them made suit for their cattle, by replevin within fifteen
days: and their suit was allowed. Within the fifteen days there came a
writ, whereby the abbot was summoned to come before <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_206" id="page_206">{206}</a></span> the court
of exchequer to answer for such act, and that the cattle taken should
in the meantime be delivered up without charge. For the Bishop of Ely,
who was an eloquent and well-spoken man, in his own person had made
complaint thereof to the justiciary and the nobles of England, saying
that a most unheard-of piece of arrogance had been committed in the
land of St. Etheldreda in time of peace; wherefore many were highly
indignant with the abbot.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile another cause of disagreement arose between the
bishop and the abbot. A certain young man of Glemsford had been
summoned to the court of St. Edmund, for a breach of the King's peace,
and had been sought for a long while. At length the steward of the
bishop brought forth that young man in the county court, claiming the
jurisdiction of the court of St. Etheldreda, and exhibiting the
charters and privileges of his lord; but our bailiffs, claiming the
jurisdiction of the plaint and the seisin of such liberty, could not
be heard. The county court, indeed, put that plaint in respite until
the justices in eyre should arrive, wherefore St. Edmund was ousted of
his jurisdiction. The abbot, on hearing this, proposed to go over to
the King; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_207"
id="page_207">{207}</a></span> but because he was sick, he decided to
defer the matter till the Purification.</p>

<p>And, behold! on St. Agnes day there came the King's messenger,
bearing the writ of our lord the Pope, wherein it was contained, that
the bishop of Ely and the abbot of St. Edmund should make inquisition
concerning Geoffrey Fitz-Peter and William de Stutville, and certain
other lords of England who had taken the cross, for whom the King
required discharge, alleging their personal infirmity, and the
necessity for their advice in the government of his kingdom. The same
messenger also brought letters from our lord the King, commanding that
he, upon the sight thereof, should come to him to confer upon the
message of our lord the Pope. The abbot was troubled in his mind, and
said, "I am straitened on every side; I must either offend God or the
King: by the very God, whatsoever may be the consequence to me, I will
not wittingly lie."</p>

<p>Therefore, returning home with all speed, somewhat weakened by
infirmity of body and humbled, and (as was not his wont) timid, by the
intervention of the prior, he sought advice of us (a thing he
heretofore had seldom done), as to what course he was to pursue in
respect of the liberties of the church which <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_208" id="page_208">{208}</a></span> were in jeopardy, and
whence the money was to come if he took his journey, and to whom the
keeping of the abbey was to be committed, and what should be done for
his poor servants who had a long time served him. And the answer was,
that he might go, and that he was at liberty to take up at interest
sufficient money, to be payable out of our sacristy and from our
pittances, and from our other rents at his pleasure; and that he
should give the abbey in charge to the prior, and some other clerk
whom he had enriched, and who could, in the interval, live upon his
own means, that thereby a saving might take place in the expenses of
the abbot, and that he might give to each of his servants money
proportioned to his length of service.</p>

<p>He, hearing such counsel, was pleased therewith, and so it was
done. The abbot, therefore, coming into chapter the day before he took
his departure, caused to be brought with him all his books, and these
he presented to the church and convent, and commended our counsel
which we had signified to him through the prior.</p>

<p>In the meantime we heard certain persons murmuring, saying that the
abbot is careful and solicitous for the liberties of his own barony,
but he keeps <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_209"
id="page_209">{209}</a></span> silence respecting the liberties of the
convent which we have lost in his time; namely, concerning the lost
court and liberties of the cellarer, and the liberty of the sacrist,
as regards the appointment of the bailiffs of the town by the convent.
Therefore, the Lord raised up the spirit of three brethren of but
indifferent knowledge, who, having got many others to join them,
conferred with the prior thereupon, in order that he should speak with
the abbot respecting these matters. On our behalf the prior was to ask
him, at his departure, to provide for the security of his church in
respect of those liberties. On hearing this, the abbot answered that
no more was to be said upon the subject, swearing that so long as he
lived he would be the master; but towards evening he talked more
mildly thereupon with the prior.</p>

<p>On the morrow, indeed, sitting in chapter, as he was about to
depart and ask licence so to do, he said he had satisfied all his
servants, and had made his will just as if he was now to die; and
beginning to speak concerning those liberties, he justified himself,
saying that he had changed the ancient customs in order that there
should not be a default in the administration of the King's justice,
and threw the blame upon the sacrist, and said that if Durand, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_210" id="page_210">{210}</a></span> town
bailiff, who was now sick, should die, the sacrist might hold the
bailiwick in his own hand, and present a bailiff to the chapter for
approval, as the custom had been of old, so nevertheless that this be
done with the assent of the abbot; but the gifts and offerings to be
made yearly by the bailiff he would in no wise remit.</p>

<p>Now, when we asked him what was to be done in respect of the
cellarer's court which was lost, and especially of the halfpence which
the cellarer was accustomed to receive for renewing pledges, he became
angry, and asked us in his turn by what authority we demanded the
exercise of regal jurisdiction, and those things which appertain to
regalities.</p>

<p>To this it was replied that we had possessed it from the foundation
of the church, and even three years after he had come to the abbacy,
and this liberty of renewing pledges we possessed in every one of our
manors. We stated that we ought not to lose our right in consideration
of a hundred shillings, which he received privately from the town
bailiff every year; and we boldly required of him to give us such
seisin thereof as we had had even in his time.</p>

<p>The abbot, being as it were at a loss for an answer, and willing
enough to leave us all in peace <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_211"
id="page_211">{211}</a></span> and to depart quietly, ordered that those
halfpence and the other matters which the cellarer demanded should be
sequestrated until his return; and he promised that upon his return he
would co-operate with us in everything, and make just order and
disposition, and render to each what was justly his. On his saying
this, all was quiet again; but the calm was not very great, for</p>

<h2><span class="uline"><br />APPENDIX I</span><br />
<span class="smcap">samson as an author.</span></h2>


<p class="nodent"><span class="smcap">Samson</span> having been
generally looked upon as a man of action rather than as a man of
letters, it seems desirable to consider at greater length than is
possible in the general Introduction, his claims to be regarded as a
literary character.</p>

<p>In the Bodleian Library at Oxford is a huge codex of 898 pages (MS.
240) in a script of the 14th century. This once belonged to Bury
Abbey, as at the beginning is the note "Liber monachorum Sancti
Edmundi, in quo continetur secunda pars Historia auree, quam scribi
fecit dominus Rogerus de Huntedoun sumptibus graciarum suarum anno
domini <span class="smcap">mccc.lxxvii</span><sup>o</sup>." Over the
title is written on the margin "Thomas Prise possidet," and in another
hand "Io. Anglicus erat author."</p>

<p>There is considerable difficulty in assigning the exact
authorship of this work: but that it was compiled at Bury is certain,
and it was no doubt added to as new materials turned up or were deemed
worthy of admission, especially such as were connected with St.
Edmundsbury. Dr. Carl Horstman has published in the preface to Vol. I.
of his <i>Nova Legenda Anglie</i> (Oxf. Univ. Press, 1901) a summary
of the contents of this book which throws much new light on its
<i>provenance</i>. It is, as he says, "the depository of documents of
Bury Abbey, and not the work <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_216"
id="page_216">{216}</a></span> of one individual; but the joint work, the
common concern of the monastery, for a whole generation."</p>

<p>The MS. contains only the second part of the Historia aurea, and
with an abbreviated text; and this is followed by a collection of
miscellanies, lives of saints, poetry and documents of all sorts. Dr.
Horstman prints in his second volume the lives of several saints,
scattered through the last half of the codex.</p>

<p>The only one of these lives that need concern us is that of St.
Edmund, which is very long and detailed, and occupies 116 printed
pages. This is followed almost immediately by a chapter De modo
meditandi vel contemplandi (including St. Edmund's prayer, "Gratias
tibi ago"), and later by a compilation on monastic discipline for the
novices of Bury Abbey.</p>

<p>This Life of St. Edmund is by far the most complete extant. It is
described as "Vita et passio cum miraculis sancti Edmundi regis et
martiris, excerpta de cronicis et diuersis historiis seu legendis, de
eodem breuiter et sub compendio compilata." It is doubtless the
"Prolixa vita" from which was compiled the "abbreviata vita" included
in Abbot Curteys' Register (now at the British Museum), and printed in
Archdeacon Battely's book of 1745 (pp. 25, 149). In the margins are
given the authorities from which it is compiled, and amongst these
are, in addition to the chronicles of Blythburgh, Ely, Hoveden, Hulme,
Huntingdon, Malmesbury, Marianus, Norwich, Sarum, Waringford, and
Westminster, the writers specially identified with Bury Abbey:&mdash;Abbo
of Fleury, Herman the Archdeacon, Galfridus de Fontibus, Osbert of
Clare, Jocelin of Brakelond (from whom are taken the incidents
described in chapters viii. and xiv. of this book), and&mdash;Samson.</p>

<p>There are in all eighteen sections of the Life for which Samson is
quoted as the authority. On eight occasions <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_217" id="page_217">{217}</a></span> the word "Sampson" appears
in the margin; "Sampson abbas," eight times; "Sampson abbas sancti
Edmundi," once; "Ex libro de miraculis eius Sampson," once (the first
occasion when the name appears); and "Ex libro primo miraculorum
Sampson abb." once (the seventh occasion).</p>

<p>Before considering Samson's share in the collection of materials
relative to the history of St. Edmund, a few words must be said about
the earlier writers on the subject.</p>

<p>The first contributor to the tangle of legends and miracles
connected with St. Edmund and his shrine was <span
class="smcap">Abbo</span>, of Fleury, a great monastery on the Loire
above Orleans, founded in the 7th century. A native of Orleans, Abbo
was sent early to the monastic school at Fleury, where he mastered
five of the seven arts, viz., grammar, arithmetic, dialectic,
astronomy and music. (Migne's <i>Patrologia</i>, vol. 139.) A
deputation coming to Fleury from the monks of Ramsey Abbey, asking
that a man of learning might be sent to them, Abbo was selected for
the office, and he remained two years in England, when he was
recalled. He died from a spear-thrust in November, 1004. Whilst in
England (circa 985) he heard from Archbishop Dunstan the story of St.
Edmund's death, as related to Dunstan when a youth by an old man who
said he was armour-bearer to St. Edmund on the day of his death (20th
November, 870). At the entreaty of the monks of Ramsey, Abbo put this
story into writing, prefacing it with a dedicatory epistle to Dunstan
in which he says that the work is sent to the Archbishop because every
part of it, except the last miracle, is related on his authority.</p>

<p>Abbo being "composition master" to the student monks at Ramsey, he
wrote, as Mr. Arnold says (I. xiv.), "with that freedom with which men
whose information is scanty, and their imagination strong, are not
sorry to enjoy." Lord Francis Hervey, in a masterly analysis of the
facts and fictions <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_218"
id="page_218">{218}</a></span> of St. Edmund's life in his Notes to Robert
Reyce's <i>Breviary of Suffolk</i> (1902), thus sums the matter with
great truth: "Abbo's treatise, with its declamatory flourishes and
classical tags, is for historical purposes all but worthless."</p>

<p>The copies extant of Abbo's <i>Passio</i> are numerous. (For List,
see Hardy's Catalogue, vol. i, p. 526.) At least four of them (two in
the Cottonian collection, one at the Bodleian, and one at Lambeth)
belonged to Bury Abbey, the earliest being Tiberius B. ii., which has
on fol. 1<i>a</i> the words "Liber feretrariorum S. Edmundi in quo
continentur uita passio et miracula S. Edmundi." It is a beautiful MS.
of the end of the eleventh or beginning of the twelfth century; "and
the gold enrichment is sometimes splendid" (Arnold I. lxv.), though
the illumination is unfinished. The other Cottonian MS. (Titus A.
viii.) is of the thirteenth century, and has on fol. 65 the words
"Liber monachorum S. Edmundi." (Both these books will be referred to
later.)</p>

<p>The next writer on the subject was <span class="smcap">Herman the
Archdeacon</span>, who, at the end of the eleventh century, wrote a
treatise <i>De Miraculis Sancti Eadmundi</i>.</p>

<p>Herman was Archdeacon to Bishop Arfast of Thetford, at the time
when the latter first endeavoured to establish his see at Bury; but
later he must have become a monk of St. Edmund, and he manifests in
his narrative enthusiastic devotion to the monastery. In the prologue
he explains that he compiled his work at the request of Abbot Baldwin
"felicis memoriæ" (died 1097), partly from oral tradition, partly from
an old and almost undecipherable manuscript "exarata calamo cujusdam
difficillimo, et, ut ita dicam, adamantino." Mr. Arnold has printed
the text of Herman on pp. 26-92 of his vol. I. from the Cottonian
volume Tiberius B. ii. above referred to, which is composed of Abbo's
<i>Passio</i> and Herman's <i>Miracula</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_219" id="page_219">{219}</a></span> A
third writer was <span class="smcap">Galfridus de Fontibus</span>, who
wrote in the days of Abbot Ording (1146-1156) a short tract, <i>De
Infantia Sancti Eadmundi</i>, of which only one MS. is known (in the
Cambridge University Library). Further additions to the legends and
miracles were made by <span class="smcap">Osbert</span> of <span
class="smcap">Clare</span>, prior of Westminster, who flourished
between 1108 and 1140, but whose writings are not now separately
extant, though extracts from them appear in the manuscripts of other
authors.</p>

<p>It would seem that working upon all these records, and doubtless
others which have not descended to us, Samson, at the period of his
life when he was still a subordinate officer of Bury Abbey, set about
compiling a treatise of his own. His prologue indicates that he was
moved to narrate the glorious miracles of the glorious king and martyr
St. Edmund by the orders of his superiors and the exhortations of his
fellow monks. His work seems, however, to have been mainly that of a
compiler and editor, though the prologue, described by Mr. Arnold (I.,
liii.) as "written in a massive and manly style," was doubtless of his
own composition. The work appears after Abbo's <i>Passio</i> in the
Cottonian MS. Titus A. viii., and consists of two books, Liber I.
containing sixteen chapters, and Liber II. twenty-one chapters. All
but four of the chapters in the first book refer to narratives that
had been told before by Herman, and Samson "has merely re-written
them, adding no new facts, but greatly improving the style." The
second book contains another prologue, followed by a prefatory letter;
and a hand of the fourteenth or early fifteenth century has written in
the Cottonian MS. "Osberti de Clara prioris Westmonasterii" in the
margin of the prologue, and "Incipit epistola Osberti prioris
Westmonasterii missa con. S. Edmundi de miraculis ejusdem" in the
margin at the beginning of the letter.</p>

<p>Mr. Arnold speaks of the "inflated diction and fantastical mystical
interpretations" of this (second) prologue and prefatory letter, and
says that "Samson seems simply to have annexed <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_220" id="page_220">{220}</a></span> them while making up his
own work." As, however, some of the narratives in this second book are
ascribed to Samson himself in the Bodleian MS. 240, whilst others in
the same book are ascribed to Osbert, it is manifest that some
confusion had arisen in the interval as to the respective shares of
responsibility for the narratives. But this need not prevent us from
accepting Samson as at least the compiler and editor of the work <i>De
Miraculis Sancti Edmundi</i> referred to on page xxxiv. of the
Introduction, and printed in full on pp. 107-208 of Mr. Arnold's first
volume.</p>

<p>If it be the case, as Mr. Arnold thinks (and there seems no reason
against the ascription) that the Prologue of Book I. was Samson's own
composition, it will doubtless be of interest that it should be
reproduced here as a specimen of his literary style; and a translation
of it is therefore subjoined, which follows the structure of the
original as closely as possible:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When we see the deeds of many earthly men extolled in brilliant
writings, which those skilled in letters have handed down to the
memory of posterity, it is to be wondered that we do not blush that
the great works of God, which, through His servants, have been brought
into being almost in this our very age, should through our sloth be
blotted out, and through our silence be condemned. And although those
secular historians, in the pride of their eloquence, have said very
much about small affairs, and have gained the favour and tickled the
ears of their audience by the sweetness of their speech, yet Christian
simplicity and Catholic plainness, innocent of the leaven of
superstition, are rightly preferred to them all. Indeed, the greatest
faith is to be placed in the account of those who do not wish, and do
not know how, to colour what they have heard, or, by the grace of
their words, to twist matters into one tortuous path after
another.</p>

<p>"In saying this we do not impudently speak to the discredit <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_221" id="page_221">{221}</a></span> (be that
far from us) of Churchmen who, by the divine inspiration, endowed with
wonderful eloquence, have with their words, sweeter than honey and the
honeycomb, adorned the deeds of our honoured ancestors, as it were a
golden tablet ornamented with most brilliant pearls. But verily those
are to be confuted who are carried headlong by a damnable presumption
to that with which erudition has nought to do, and to which the grace
of the Holy Spirit imparts nought.</p>

<p>"But we (whom the apostle warns lest we should despise the riches
of the goodness of God, and whom he exhorts not to receive His grace
in vain) with a truthful, albeit an unpolished style, at the command
of superior authority and by the exhortation of brotherly love, have
undertaken to tell of the glorious miracles of the glorious king and
martyr Edmund: since, indeed, it appears impious that we should allow
the lantern, which God lighted and placed upon a candlestick, to be
obscured through our sloth, or should hide it negligently under the
bushel of oblivion. For to this purpose is it placed upon a
candlestick, that it may give light to all who are in the house."</p>

<p>In which matter the victorious champion of God, Edmund,
illuminating the borders, not only of Britain, but also of foreign
lands with the glory of his miracles, gives frequent token of his
merit towards God.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p><a href="#page_1">1</a>, 4. <i>The year when the Flemings were
taken captive.</i> On the 17th October, 1173, Richard de Lucy, the
chief justiciary of King Henry II., defeated at Fornham St. Genevieve,
near Bury St. Edmunds, the rebel Robert de Beaumont, Earl of
Leicester, who had landed from Flanders at Walton in Suffolk on the
29th September, 1173, at the head of a force of Flemings. The
chroniclers speak of large numbers of the foreign mercenaries as being
killed at the battle of Fornham. The Earl and Countess of Leicester
were captured, and imprisoned at Falaise till 1174. For an interesting
description of the battle, with many references to the chronicles, see
Miss Kate Norgate's <i>England under the Angevin Kings</i>, II.
150-1.</p>

<p><a href="#page_1">1</a>, 10. <i>Hugh the Abbot.</i> Hugh, Prior of
Westminster, succeeded Ording as 9th Abbot of St. Edmundsbury in 1157.
Gervase records his being blessed by Archbishop Theobald at
Colchester, and his vowing to him canonical obedience. But a bull
obtained at great cost from Pope Alexander III. in 1172 (see p. 7)
made the abbey immediately subject to Rome. <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_223" id="page_223">{223}</a></span> Some details of the
occurrences during his abbacy are given in Battely, pp. 78-82.</p>

<p><a href="#page_1">1</a>, 11. Genesis xxvii. 1.</p>

<p><a href="#page_2">2</a>, 21. <i>Debt ... to Jews.</i> Whilst the
Jews were legally simply chattels of the king, they were at this time
"practically masters of the worldly interests of a large number of his
Christian subjects, and of a large portion of the wealth of his realm"
(Norgate's <i>Angevin Kings</i>, II. 487). There are many instances
besides that of St. Edmundsbury of ecclesiastical property and
furniture being pledged to the Jews, <i>e.g.</i> the sacred vessels
and jewels of Lincoln Minster were in pledge to Aaron, a rich Jew of
that city, for seven years or more before Geoffrey, bishop-elect,
redeemed them in 1173.</p>

<p><a href="#page_3">3</a>, 6. <i>Benedict the Jew.</i> In 1171
"Benedict the Jew, son of Deodate, was fined xx<sup>li</sup> for
taking certain sacred vestments in pawn." (Pipe Rolls, Norf. and Suff.
17 Hen. II.) Other fines on Jews are recorded by Rokewode (pp.
106-7).</p>

<p><a href="#page_3">3</a>, 9. <i>William the sacrist.</i> From the
<i>Gesta Sacristarum</i> (Arnold II. 291) we learn of this officer,
who was once Samson's superior, afterwards a rival candidate for the
abbacy, and finally Samson's subordinate, "Huic [Schuch] successit
Willelmus cognomento Wiardel; qui non sine causa a domino Samsone
abbate amotus fuit ab administratione." His evil deeds recorded by
Jocelin appear therefore to have been remembered.</p>

<p><a href="#page_6">6</a>, 1. <i>Richard the Archbishop.</i> Richard
was a Norman by birth and of humble parentage; and was prior of Dover
when the question of filling up the primacy was discussed 2½ years
after Becket's murder on 29th December, 1170. There was a disputed
election, but Robert, by the Court influence, won the day over Odo,
Prior of Canterbury; and eventually his election was confirmed by Pope
Alexander III. on 2nd April, 1174. Immediately after his
enthronisation (5th October, 1174) Richard held a legatine visitation
of his province; and as he rode with a great train, his visits were
specially grievous to the religious houses that had to receive
him.</p>

<p><a href="#page_6">6</a>, 19. <i>Sent to Acre.</i> Castleacre,
Westacre, and Southacre, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_224"
id="page_224">{224}</a></span> in Norfolk, are all described in Domesday
book as "Acra." There were two Priories, one at Castleacre, the other
at Westacre; but the former was the more famous of the two. As it was
a Cluniac institution, and as the Cluniacs were a kind of stricter
Benedictines, it seems most probable that it was to Castleacre that
Samson was sent as a punishment. Apparently this was his second
banishment there; for he speaks here to Jocelin (then a novice, and
who joined the monastery in 1173) as though of recent events. (As to
his first imprisonment after his return from Rome about 1161, see page
74 and note on p. 237.) The Priory of Castleacre was founded about
1084 by William de Warrenne, created by the Conqueror Earl of Surrey,
and the progenitor of that famous sixth Earl who fought Baliol and
Wallace in Scotland, and who, when called upon by the King's
Commissioners to produce the title by which he held his possessions,
drew his sword and laid it on the table. Some remarkably beautiful
ruins of the Priory, particularly of its west front and the Prior's
Lodge, have happily escaped the ravages of the village builders, who
for centuries used the ruins as a stone quarry.</p>

<p><a href="#page_6">6</a>, 24. Exodus v. 21.</p>

<p><a href="#page_7">7</a>, 4. <i>authority as legate.</i> Mr.
Rokewode goes at length (pp. 107-8) into the documents relative to the
claim of the monks of St. Edmund to exemption under Royal authority
from ordinary episcopal jurisdiction. The Bull of 1172 which they
obtained from Pope Alexander III. exempted them from the jurisdiction
of any other ecclesiastical authority than the Pontiff or his
<i>legatus a latere</i>. Shortly afterwards the Monastery was exempted
from the personal interference of Archbishop Richard as legate <i>a
latere</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#page_8">8</a>, 5. <i>Jurnet the Jew.</i> Rokewode quotes
(pp. 108-9) from the Pipe Rolls of Henry II. the following: In 23
Henry II., Jurnet the Jew of Norwich was amerced in <span
class="smcap">mm</span> marcs; and he stood amerced, in the 31st year
of the same king, in <span class="smcap">mmmmmdxxv</span> marcs and a
half, for which debt the whole body of Jews were chargeable: and they
were to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_225"
id="page_225">{225}</a></span> have Jurnet's effects and chattels to
enable them to pay it. He gave King Richard <span
class="smcap">mdccc</span> marcs that he might reside in England with
the King's good will.</p>

<p><a href="#page_10">10</a>, 23. <i>morrow of St. Brice.</i> November
15, 1180. Hugh was buried in the Chapter House nearest the door, sixth
and last of the six abbots buried there, as recorded in a MS. at Douai
circa 1425. The other five were:&mdash;Ording (1146-1156), Samson
(1182-1211), Richard of Insula (1229-1234), Henry of Rushbrook
(1234-1248), Edmund of Walpole (1248-1257). The lidless coffins of
these five, with skeletons within, were discovered January 1, 1903.
The coffin of Hugh had disappeared, but bones which may have been his
were found buried at the spot.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p><a href="#page_12">12</a>, 3. <i>Ranulf de Glanville.</i> The
famous author of the oldest of our legal classics, the "Treatise on
the Laws and Customs of England," was of Suffolk stock, and was born
at Stratford St. Andrew, Saxmundham. He succeeded Richard Lucy as
chief justiciary of England, and thenceforward he was the king's
right-hand man (Richard of Devizes called him the "King's eye"). At
the moment of Abbot Hugh's death Henry II. was in France (he kept that
Christmas at Le Mans), so the monks appreciated the importance of
letting Glanville as justiciary know at once the fact of the vacancy.
Glanville took the cross, and died at the siege of Acre in 1180.</p>

<p><a href="#page_12">12</a>, 11. <i>wardship of the Abbey.</i> The
accounts rendered by the wardens during the abbatial vacancy have been
fortunately preserved in the returns which Wimer, the Sheriff of
Norfolk and Suffolk, made to the Exchequer for the 27 and 28 Henry II.
Mr. Rokewode gives the actual text of them (pp. 110-1). The rental of
the Abbot from Michaelmas, 1180, to Michaelmas, 1181, was £326
12<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>: out of which £56 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> was
paid for corrodies, including £21 for Abbot <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_226" id="page_226">{226}</a></span> Hugh's expenses for the six
weeks before his death, and £35 for the Archbishop of Trontheim.</p>

<p><a href="#page_14">14</a>, 2. Deuteronomy xvi. 19.</p>

<p><a href="#page_14">14</a>, 9. <i>paintings.</i> For an interesting
discussion as to these paintings, and the subjects of them, see
<i>James</i>, pp. 130 <i>et seq.</i></p>

<p><a href="#page_14">14</a>, 11. <i>building the great tower.</i>
Samson's work as subsacrist in connection with this tower is thus
described by James, page 119: "Samson finished one storey in the great
tower at the west end. This was a western tower occupying a position
similar to that of the western tower at Ely, immediately over the
central western door." It was <i>not</i> this tower (as stated by
Rokewode, page 111) that fell down on 23 Sept., 1210, but the central
tower (see James, pp. 121-203).</p>

<i>Phormio</i>, Act. 2, Sc. 3, 14.</p>

<p><a href="#page_17">17</a>, 12. <i>Abbot Ording.</i> In the
dedication to Abbot Ording of the <i>Liber de Infantia Sancti
Eadmundi</i> by Galfridus de Fontibus, Ording is said (Arnold, i. 93)
to have been "watchful in attendance on the King from his boyhood."
Apparently this King was Stephen (born about 1097), as Henry II., his
successor, was not born until 1133. At that time Ording would have
been on duty at Bury: for he was already Prior in 1136, when Anselm,
then Abbot, was nominated for the Bishopric of London. Ording was
appointed in 1138 Abbot in Anselm's place; but as the latter failed to
get his nomination to the See of London confirmed by the Pope, he came
back to Bury. Ording therefore, "sive volens sive nolens" had to
return to his duties as Prior; but when Anselm died in 1148, Ording
was re-elected Abbot, and held office till he died in 1156. As to his
place of burial, see note to p. 152, l. 5, on p. 247.</p>

<p><a href="#page_17">17</a>, 23. Matthew xvi. 19.</p>

<p><a href="#page_18">18</a>, 9. <i>Barrators of Norfolk.</i>
Barrator==an incitor to lawsuits <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_227"
id="page_227">{227}</a></span> (from O. Fr. <i>bareter</i>, to deceive,
cheat). The men of Norfolk were noted for their litigious propensities
(cf. Tusser's rhyming autobiography: "Norfolk wiles, so full of
guiles"). Fuller in his <i>Worthies</i> says: "Whereas <i>pedibus
ambulando</i> is accounted but a vexatious suit in other countries,
here (where men are said to study law as following the plough-tail)
some would persuade us that they will enter an action for their
neighbour's horse but looking over their hedge." An Act was passed in
1455 (33 Hen. VI. cap. 7) to check the litigiousness of "the City of
Norwich, and the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk."</p>

<p><a href="#page_21">21</a>, 4. Romans xvi. 5.</p>

<p><a href="#page_21">21</a>, 6. <i>Blood-letting season</i> (tempore
minutionis). At stated times of the year there was a general
blood-letting among the monks; and in the same <i>Liber Albus</i> in
which Jocelin's chronicle appears is a set of Regulations <i>De
Minutis Sanguine</i> (fol. 193). Amongst the servants in the infirmary
of Bury Monastery was <i>Minutor, cum garcione</i> (<i>id.</i> fol.
44). The effects of the minutio were supposed to last three days,
during which the monk did not go to matins.</p>

Eystein (Augustinus) Archbishop of Trontheim, refusing to crown
Sverrir, a successful rebel, who had defeated Magnus, King of Norway,
was driven into exile and came to England. (William de Newburgh, iii.
16.) Rokewode (p. 113) shows from the accounts of the Wardens of the
Abbey during the vacancy, that the corrodies allowed to the Archbishop
amounted in all to £94 10s.</p>

<p><a href="#page_23">23</a>, 11. <i>Holy child Robert.</i> Nothing is

<p><a href="#page_31">31</a>, 15. <i>Geoffrey the Chancellor.</i>
Geoffrey was a natural son of Henry II.&mdash;it is generally stated as by
Fair Rosamond, though this is now discredited by the facts adduced in
the <i>Dict. Nat. Biog.</i> He was successively Bishop of Lincoln
(1173), Chancellor (1182), Archbishop of York (1191), and after a
violent quarrel with King John, fled the country in 1207, dying in
Normandy in 1212.</p>

<p><a href="#page_32">32</a>, 5. Matthew xix. 30; Mark x. 31.</p>

<p><a href="#page_34">34</a>, 23. <i>By the very eyes of God</i>: "per
veros oculos Dei!" This was a favourite oath of Henry II. In a
contemporary metrical life of St. Thomas of Canterbury, the King is
more than once made to exclaim "Par les oilz Dieu" (Rokewode, p. 115).
William II. used to swear by "the holy Face of Lucca"; John by "the
teeth of God" (Ramsay, <i>Angevin Empire</i> (1903), p. 414).</p>

<p><a href="#page_35">35</a>, 7. <i>Miserere mei Deus.</i> Psalm

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p><a href="#page_37">37</a>, 24. <i>Threshold of the gate.</i> Samson
alighted at what is now known as the "Norman Tower."</p>

<p><a href="#page_38">38</a>, 4. <i>Martyri adhuc.</i> Rokewode gives
on page 115 the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_229"
id="page_229">{229}</a></span> text (with the musical notes) of this
response, the words of which are: "Martyri adhuc palpitanti, sed
Christum confitenti, jussit Inguar caput auferri: sicque Edmundus
martyrium consummavit, et ad Deum exultans vadit." In a MS. (Digby
109) now at the Bodleian Library (which contains also a copy of Abbo's
<i>Passio</i>) this response comes after the 5th lesson of the office
of St. Edmund.</p>

<p><a href="#page_39">39</a>, 23. John vi. 6.</p>

<p><a href="#page_39">39</a>, 24. <i>New seal.</i> A representation of
this seal is given as the Frontispiece. It is taken from an instrument
in the Archives of Canterbury Cathedral, dated 6 November, 1200, being
an award in a dispute between the Archbishop of Canterbury and the
Canons of Lambeth, referred by Pope Innocent III. to Hugh, Bishop of
Lincoln (for whom Roger, Dean of Lincoln, was substituted), Eustace,
Bishop of Ely, and Abbot Samson.</p>

<p>The seal represents Abbot Samson, vested in amice, alb, tunic,
dalmatic, chasuble, rationale, and mitre. He holds a crozier in his
right hand and a closed book in his left. The mitre is unusually large
for the date. The inscription is broken, but in full reads thus:
"Sigillum Samsonis Dei Gratia Abbatis Sancti Eadmundi." The
counterseal (much smaller) displays the lamb bearing a cross, with the
words round the circumference, "Secretum Samsonis Abbatis."</p>

<p><a href="#page_41">41</a>, 9. <i>Thomas of Hastings.</i> Apparently
the object of Thomas in introducing thus early his nephew, Henry of
Hastings, to the notice of Samson, was to secure a recognition by the
new Abbot of the claims of his family to the hereditary stewardship of
the Liberty of St. Edmund. By Charter of William I., Lidgate in
Suffolk, and Blunham in Bedfordshire (where the church is dedicated to
St. Edmund), were given to one Ralph to hold in fee of the Abbot of
St. Edmund by the service of Dapifer or Steward. Later, between 1115
and 1119, Abbot Albold granted the lands, with the office held by
Ralph, to Maurice of Windsor and his heirs, and this grant was
confirmed by King Stephen. Maurice was succeeded by Ralph of Hastings,
his nephew, and Ralph by William of Hastings, his nephew; and Henry,
on <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_230" id="page_230">{230}</a></span>
whose behalf the claim of the stewardship was made to Samson, was
William's son and heir. The Abbot admitted that his right was
indisputable (the original Charters of William I., Abbot Albold,
Stephen, and Henry II. [two] are quoted by Rokewode, pp. 118-120). But
Samson's point seems to have been that Henry was too young to give
personal service as Steward, and therefore "the business was
deferred." Rokewode observes (p. 117): "Henry continued a minor in
1188, his office being then filled by Robert of Flamville, who held it
at the time of his being one of the Wardens of the Abbey during the
vacancy" (see p. 12). In Reece's <i>Breviary of Suffolk</i> (1902) John
of Hastings is given as Lord of the Manor of Lidgate in 1315.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<p><a href="#page_43">43</a>, 11. <i>Enclosed many parks.</i> At the
Abbot's manor at Melford was an old deer park of very ancient
foundation. It was called Elmsett or Aelmsethe, or the Great Park, and
consisted chiefly of open wood. It was in olden times termed "Magnus
Boscus Domini," and in the surveys of Edward I. and Henry VI. it is
reckoned both as park and wood, the wood part being in the latter
survey 217a. 2r. 34p. The whole was impaled round and stored with
deer. (Parker's <i>Melford</i>, pp. 310-11).</p>

<p><a href="#page_43">43</a>, 12. <i>beasts of chase.</i> The "Beasts
of the Chase" in Angevin days were the buck, doe and fox: the "Beasts
of the Forest" were the hart, hind and hare: and the "Beasts and Fowls
of the Warren" were the hare, rabbit ("coney"), pheasant and
partridge. The fox was coupled with the wolf in Canute's Forest Law,
No. 27, as "neither forest beasts nor game." When the fox was made a
Beast of the Chase cannot be ascertained with any precision. The same
Law No. 27, protected "hares, rabbits and roedeer"; the last are not
mentioned in later times. In addition to the animals above named, the
otter was hunted&mdash;<i>vide</i> Patent Rolls of Henry III. of 1221. The
badger, polecat or wild cat (<i>catus</i>) and marten are specified as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_231" id="page_231">{231}</a></span>
beasts which receivers of royal licences might hunt "with their own
hounds" in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. There appears to be
no such charter or licence granting leave to hunt "the King's great
game" (deer): on the contrary, deer are often specially reserved.</p>

<p><a href="#page_43">43</a>, 12. <i>Keeping a huntsman with dogs.</i>
The St. Edmund breed of dogs seems to have been celebrated, as Richard
I., when there was a difference between him and Samson as to the
wardship of Nesta of Cockfield, wrote to the Abbot in a friendly way,
and asked him for some of his dogs (page 148). The hunting dog of old
times was probably a light sort of mastiff. Sometimes a breed was more
celebrated for speed or for strength or for courage, as in the case of
the hounds bred by the abbots of Bury. In the course of time the
slighter varieties developed into the greyhound, and the thicker into
the mastiff of modern times. Canute's Forest Law 31 forbade possession
of "the dog which the English call greihounds" to the lower classes.
Henry II.'s Assize of the Forest, given at Woodstock 1184, forbids
(Clause 2) any one entering a royal forest with bow, arrows, dogs or
greyhounds, save with special warrant. Clause 14 requires the lawing
of mastiffs.</p>

<p>The Wardrobe Account of Edward I. for 1299-1300, records payment
for maintenance of twelve "<i>fox dogs</i>." These were used to kill
foxes in coverts previously netted round, so were not, probably,
"running hounds." On April 11, 1279, Edward I. wrote to Charles of
Salerno promising to send the harriers asked for by the latter: which
seems to indicate that the English harrier had a high reputation at
that period.</p>

<p><a href="#page_43">43</a>, 16. <i>take part in the sport.</i>
Strutt, in his <i>Sports and Pastimes</i>, observes:&mdash;"By the game
laws of Canute, the dignified clergy were permitted to hunt in the
forests belonging to the Crown; and their prerogatives were not
abrogated by the Normans. Henry II., displeased at the power and
ambition of the ecclesiastics, endeavoured to render these grants of
none effect by putting in force (1157) the canon law, which strictly
forbade the clergy to spend their time in hunting and hawking." <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_232" id="page_232">{232}</a></span> Henry
III.'s First Charter of 1217 gave leave to an archbishop, bishop, earl
or baron to take two deer while passing through a forest "by view of
the forester"; or in the absence of that official the sportsman was to
blow a horn on killing.</p>

<p><a href="#page_44">44</a>, 14. <i>The Eight Hundreds.</i> These
eight hundreds of Thingoe, Thedwastre, Blackbourn, Bradbourn,
Bradmere, Lackford, Risbridge and Babergh, with the half hundred of
Cosford (see line 18) constituted the Liberty of St. Edmund, as to
which see note on page 238.</p>

<p><a href="#page_44">44</a>, 15. <i>Robert of Cockfield.</i> See note
to pp. 86, l. 18, on page 241, and cf. pages 254-6.</p>

<p><a href="#page_44">44</a>, 24. <i>Hidages, foddercorn,
hen-rents.</i> Hidage was a tax upon every hide of land; foddercorn an
ancient feudal right that the lord should be provided with fodder for
his horses; hen-rents were a common reservation upon inferior
tenures.</p>

<p><a href="#page_45">45</a>, 11. <i>Kalendar.</i> A transcript of
this kalendar, which, as stated in the text (p. 45, l. 2) was completed
by 1186, is now in the possession of Prince Frederick Dhuleep Singh.
In the <i>History of the Hundred of Thingoe</i> (1838) an extract from
it relating to that Hundred is given on pp. xii.-xvii.</p>

<p><a href="#page_46">46</a>, 1. <i>Hugh the subsacrist.</i> Jocelin
says that Samson appointed Hugh subsacrist to William Wiardel, and
shortly after (p. 47) made Samson the precentor sacrist. But this
arrangement was probably short-lived, for the <i>Gesta Sacristarum</i>
(Arnold, ii. 290) says Hugh succeeded William as sacrist, and gives a
lengthy list of the works he carried out in the church. In 1198, when
the body of St. Edmund was examined, Hugh was present, and is
described as sacrist (see p. 172).</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p><a href="#page_62">62</a>, 7. <i>Pulpit.</i> This pulpit, from
which Samson preached in his native dialect of Norfolk, was one of the
works of Hugo the sacrist (Arnold, ii. 291).</p>

<p><a href="#page_65">65</a>, 3. <i>Norfolk Barrator.</i> See note to
p. 18, line 9 (pages 226-7).</p>

<p><a href="#page_66">66</a>, 21. <i>Sale of holy water.</i> Ducange
cites the acts of a synod of Exeter in 1287, that from ancient times
the profits arising from the distribution of holy water had been set
apart to maintain poor clerks in schools.</p>

<p><a href="#page_68">68</a>, 23. <i>Schools.</i> Samson is usually
credited with having founded a town school in connection with the
monastery. This may very likely have been the case, but I have found
no direct evidence of it. It seems from this passage that at any rate
he provided free lodgings for poor scholars, and from p. 144 that he
endowed the mastership of the schools with half the tithes of
Wetherden. There is a street at Bury St. Edmunds, just outside the
precincts of the monastery, known as School Hall Street.</p>

<p><a href="#page_69">69</a>, 3. <i>Manor of Mildenhall.</i> Edward
the Confessor gave Mildenhall to St. Edmund's, but when Domesday Book
was compiled it was in the hands of the Crown, being then worth £70.
Amongst the Crown lands sold by Richard I. immediately after his
accession was this manor, purchased, according to Jocelin, for 1,100
marks, of which 1,000 marks apparently went to the King, and 100 marks
to Queen Eleanor (see p. 71, l. 3). See also note to p. 72, l. 4, on
page 235.</p>

<p><a href="#page_69">69</a>, 5. <i>Expulsion of the Jews.</i> Arnold
(i. 249) expresses the opinion that, "under the circumstances, this
must have been the most humane course in the interests of the Jews
themselves. All large English towns at this time were imperfectly
policed, and the temper of the populace savage and uncertain. A riot
having once been set on foot, the only hope of safety for the Jews was
in taking refuge in some royal castle. There was no <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_234" id="page_234">{234}</a></span> castle at
Bury; to the Abbot alone could the survivors [from the massacre in
1190] look for protection; and Samson knew that he had not sufficient
force at his command to ensure it to them."</p>

<p><a href="#page_69">69</a>, 6. <i>New hospital at Babwell.</i> The
ruins of this hospital, dedicated to the Saviour, still exist in
Northgate, beyond the railway arch. It was originally founded for a
warden, twelve chaplains, six clerks, twelve poor gentlemen, and
twelve poor women, and was the subject of numerous Charters, which
will be found fully described in Chapter II. of the late Sir Wm.
Parker's <i>History of Long Melford</i> (1873). In the Feet of Fines
for Suffolk, 1 John (1199), there are references to two deeds entered
into by "Walter, Master of the Hospital of the Blessed Saviour outside
the northern gate of St. Edmund's." The Master of the Hospital had his
manor at Melford and held his courts: which manor remains to the
present day, as the <i>Manor of the Monks in Melford</i>. It was at
St. Saviour's Hospital that Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, put up when
he was arrested, in February, 1447, by Henry VI., who was in the town
for the Parliament which met in the refectory of Bury Abbey.</p>

<p><a href="#page_70">70</a>, 9. <i>Great roll of Winchester.</i>
Domesday Book: the returns forming the basis of which were transmitted
to a board sitting at Winchester, by whom they were arranged in order
and placed upon record (Lingard, i. 249).</p>

<p><a href="#page_70">70</a>, 19. <i>Custom of the realm.</i> This
custom is described by Blackstone (<i>Commentaries</i> [1844 ed.] i.
229) as an ancient perquisite called queen-gold or aurum reginæ, due,
in the proportion of 10 per cent., from every person making a
voluntary offering to the King.</p>

<p><a href="#page_71">71</a>, 1. <i>Ransom of King Richard.</i>
Richard wrote to his mother from Haguenau on the 19th April, 1193, a
letter notifying the 70,000 marks demanded for his ransom by the
German Emperor Henry VI. To meet this, the monasteries of England
handed over all their gold and silver to royal commissioners, and
amongst the treasure delivered up by St. Edmund's was the golden
chalice given to the Abbey by Henry II. Queen <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_235" id="page_235">{235}</a></span> Eleanor's release of it is
printed in the <i>Monasticon</i> (1821 ed.), iii. 154 (see also p. 146
of the <i>Chronicle</i>).</p>

<p><a href="#page_71">71</a>, 19. <i>Icklingham.</i> This appears to
be the transaction referred to in a Charter of 1200, granted by Samson
(confirmed by King John 15th March, 1200):&mdash;"We further give and grant
to the said Hospital of St. Saviour, for the maintenance of the poor
folk, £12 in money from our town of Icklingham, to be annually
received through our sacrist." The signatures to this Charter (given
in Parker's <i>Melford</i>, p. 9) are interesting. They include
"Herbert, the prior," "Hermer, the sub-prior" (see chapter xvi. of
this book), and "Jocelin, the almoner" (our Chronicler).</p>

<p><a href="#page_72">72</a>, 4. <i>confirmed by the King's
Charter.</i> Richard I. signed at Chateau Galliard on 18th July, 1198,
two charters (1) confirming to Abbot Samson the manor and advowson of
Mildenhall; (2) placing the manor, except Icklingham, at the disposal
of the sacrist on certain conditions. At the accession of King John,
Samson gave the King £200 for a confirmation of the first Charter, and
especially of Mildenhall (cf. Rokewode, pp. 124-5).</p>

<p><a href="#page_72">72</a>, 15. <i>Walter of Coutances.</i> The
Church at Woolpit was the first piece of preferment of this famous
Archbishop. Walter apparently succeeded, at Woolpit, Geoffrey Ridel,
made Bishop of Ely in 1173 (see note on page 237). Rokewode says (p.
126): "Henry II. obtained from Hugh, Abbot of St. Edmund's, in free
alms, the Church of Woolpit for his clerk, Walter de Coutances, and in
consideration thereof, by charter dated at Winchester, granted that
after the decease of Walter or his resignation, the Church should be
appropriated to the use of the sick monks" (<i>Reg. Nigr.</i> fol. 104
v.). Walter obtained several other appointments, but seems from the
text to have retained the Church at Woolpit till 1183, when he was
consecrated Bishop of Lincoln. Next year (1184) he was elected
Archbishop of Rouen. He took a prominent part in the troubles of the
reigns of Richard I. and John, and died at Rouen on 16th November,
1207.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_236" id="page_236">{236}</a></span>
<a href="#page_72">72</a>, 22. <i>Pope Alexander and Octavian.</i>
Alexander III., elected Pope on 7 September, 1159, was obliged to
leave Italy in 1162, on account of the power of the Anti-Pope
Octavian, and did not return until the decease of the latter in 1164.
Samson's journey to Rome was, therefore, between 1159 and 1162, before
he became a professed monk.</p>

<p><a href="#page_73">73</a>, 3. <i>Pretended to be Scotch.</i> Mr.
Arnold gives as the reason for this that "the Scottish kingdom at this
time naturally sided with Octavian, England being in favour of
Alexander" (I. xliii.). It has been suggested that "simulavi me esse
Scottum" in the text means that Samson pretended to be an
<i>Irishman</i>, the name Scotus having originally signified Irish,
only acquiring its present meaning with the immigration of the Scots
from the North of Ireland into Argyll, and their growth into a
powerful nation. Bromton, speaking of Ireland, says:&mdash;"Dicta est eciam
aliquando Scotia a Scotis eam inhabitantibus, priusquam ad aliam
Scotiam Britannicam devenerunt; unde in Martirologio legitur: Tali die
apud Scotiam natalis Sanctæ Brigidæ: quod est, apud Hiberniam" (see
Twysden, <i>Historiæ Anglicanæ Scriptores X</i>, London 1652: vol. I.,
col. 1072, l. 11). When therefore this passage was written (the
fourteenth century) it is clear that the usage of Scot as meaning
Irishman was not understood, and was regarded as needing explanation.
Samson's contemporary, Ralph de Diceto, following the account of Henry
of Huntingdon, twice explains that the Scots came from Ireland (ed.
Stubbs 1876, I. 10; II. 34). This explanation again implies that by
the middle and end of the twelfth century the word had come to mean
exclusively "Scotsman." The same opinion is expressed by Burton: "It
is not safe to count that the word Scot must mean a native of present
Scotland, when the period dealt with is earlier than the middle of the
twelfth century" (<i>History of Scotland</i>, 1873, I. 207). In that
part of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle which was compiled during the reign
of King Alfred, Scot regularly means Irishman. In <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 903 the death is noted of Virgil, abbot of
the Scots, i.e. Irish: but this appears to be <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_237" id="page_237">{237}</a></span> the last instance of the
use of the word in the Chronicle in that sense. Between the years 924
and 1138 the word Scot occurs fourteen and Scotland twenty-six times
in the Chronicle, always with the modern significance.</p>

<p><a href="#page_73">73</a>, 6. <i>Gaveloc.</i> Javelin, a word of
Celtic origin, but not specifically Scotch. Matthew Paris speaks of it
in 1256 as a Frisian weapon: "Frisiones cum jaculis quæ vulgariter
gavelocos appellant." (Chr. Maj. ed. Luard. v. 550.) In the Romance of
Percival by Chrestien de Troyes, is the couplet, "Et il, qui bien
lancier savoit, De gaverlos que il avoit." (Ed. Potvin, Tome I. lines
1309-10. Mons, 1866).</p>

<p><a href="#page_73">73</a>, 10. <i>Ride, Ride Rome, turn
Cantwereberi</i>, This is written in English by Jocelin; and its
meaning seems to be "I am riding towards Rome, turning from
Canterbury." Arnold (I. xliii.) says, "If he had meant to say
'returning to Canterbury,' he would at once have been taken for an
English adherent of Alexander."</p>

<p><a href="#page_74">74</a>, 12. <i>Geoffrey Ridel.</i> This
presentation appears to have been made (c. 1161) by Henry II., perhaps
during Samson's journey abroad. In 1163 Geoffrey became Archdeacon of
Canterbury in succession to Thomas à Becket, appointed Archbishop, and
for the next eight years was in violent opposition to his primate, who
called him "our arch-devil," and excommunicated him. On May 1, 1173,
Geoffrey was chosen Bishop of Ely, and died at Winchester, 27 July,
1189. As Geoffrey from the chronicles seems to have been of a
masterful and contumacious spirit, it must have given Abbot Samson
peculiar satisfaction to have got the better of him over the timber
referred to on page 106.</p>

<p><a href="#page_74">74</a>, 19. <i>Acre.</i> This was Samson's first
imprisonment at Castleacre (circ. 1161, before he became a monk). His
second imprisonment probably took place about 1173, as on page 6 he
speaks of it to Jocelin, then a novice, as something quite recent. As
to Castleacre, see note on pages 223-4.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_238" id="page_238">{238}</a></span></p>


<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p><a href="#page_77">77</a>, 23. <i>Charters of the King.</i> This
dispute with the monks of Canterbury, heard before King Henry II. on
the 11th February, 1187, raised the whole question of the Liberty of
St. Edmund, a matter respecting which the Bury monastery was extremely
tenacious. A marginal note in the original MS. of the Chronicle,
against the puzzled phrase of the King (see page 78, lines 1-3), says:
"Our Charter speaks of the time of King Edward, and of the time of his
mother, Queen Emma, who had eight and a half hundreds as a marriage
portion before the time of King Edward, besides Mildenhall." According
to the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>, the Confessor, after his
coronation in 1043, seized the possessions of his mother, "because she
was formerly very hard on the King her son, and did less for him than
he wished before he was King, and also since." The Franchise having
thus come into the Confessor's hands, was granted to the Abbots and
Monks of Bury shortly after his accession. Under a Charter of King
Edmund granted about 945, and Charters of Canute and Hardicanute, the
jurisdiction of Bury Abbey had been restricted to the town, and the
circuit indicated by the four crosses placed at the distance of a mile
from the extremities of the town: but by the Confessor's Charter, it
was enlarged to a district extending over about two-fifths of the
whole county of Suffolk. (For names of the 8½ hundreds included in the
Liberty see note on page 232, 14.)</p>

<p>Edward the Confessor paid a visit to the shrine of St. Edmund in
1044, and when he had come within a mile of it, dismounted from his
horse and accomplished the rest of the journey on foot. Herman the
archdeacon, who wrote about half a century later, is the first to
relate this fact, and also the grant by the King to the abbey of the
8½ hundreds: "Qua tunc suffragatorem reditibus imperialibus honorat,
centurias quas Anglice hundrez vocant, octo et semis sibi circum-circa
se donat, regiamque mansionem nomine Mildenhall his adauget" (Arnold,
I. 48). The original grant of Edward the Confessor gave the abbey jura
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_239" id="page_239">{239}</a></span>
regalia in wide loose general terms. Later, Charters became gradually
more explicit as to the extent of jurisdiction (civil and criminal)
conferred. Later still, the Royal justices in eyre supervened. The
institution of the circuits and assizes had to be fitted into the
exempt jurisdiction: so the Liberty had its own assizes, etc., but
outside the interior special and inviolable circuit of the bannaleuca
or limits of St. Edmundsbury itself.</p>

<p>Lord Francis Hervey, who has made a special study of the subject,
gives hope on page 250 of his notes to the <i>Breviary of Suffolk</i>
(1902), of his undertaking "a detailed examination of the history and
incidents of the great Liberty of St. Edmund, which remained in the
hands of its monastic rulers till the day when Abbot Reeve surrendered
his Abbey to Henry VIII., November 4, 1539."</p>

<p><a href="#page_78">78</a>, 15. Matthew xix. 12.</p>

<p><a href="#page_78">78</a>, 16. <i>the matter was put off.</i> This
dispute between Bury and Canterbury was not, as a matter of fact,
ultimately composed till over 200 years later. Amongst Dr. Yates'
manuscript materials for the never completed Part II. of his
<i>History of Bury</i> is a memorandum (now amongst the Egerton MSS.
in the British Museum) in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Letters Patent of King Henry 4th the 25th Nov. 1408 confirm
and ratify an Indenture of three parts between the Archbishop of
Canterbury, the Prior of Christ Church, Canterbury, and the Abbot of
Bury St. Edmund's, by which it is determined that the parishes of
Hadleygh et Illeygh being within the eight hundreds and an half called
the Liberty or Franchise of St. Edmund should be subject to the
Abbot's Seneschallus, or High Steward of the Franchise, and that the
return of the writs of the Seneschal's Great Court with the rolls
fines and other rights and privileges should be regarded in those
parishes in the same manner as in the other parts of the Liberty. An
exemption on the part of the Archbishop having been claimed, this
indenture terminated a dispute that had been above 160 years [cf.
Arnold, III. 188] in agitation. During this dispute it was agreed that
the Sheriff of Suffolk should act <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_240" id="page_240">{240}</a></span> till its termination as
Seneschal of these Parishes. A patent was addressed to the Sheriff of
Suffolk dated 27th November in the same year, commanding him no longer
to intromit within the Franchise of St. Edmund, but to preserve
inviolate the Liberties and immunities of the Abbot and
Monastery.&mdash;<i>Registrum Rubrum in Collect, Burien.</i>: 317 <i>to</i>

<i>Arte Poet.</i>, 78.</p>

<p><a href="#page_79">79</a>, 6. <i>Bishop of Ely.</i> This was
William of Longchamp (d. 1197), once described by Henry II. as a "son
of two traitors." He fled the kingdom in 1191 on his fall from power,
came to England in 1192, but was not permitted to proceed further than
Canterbury, and crossed the seas again. In 1193 he returned, bearing
letters from the Emperor, and met the Regency at St. Albans. It was on
this occasion that he passed through St. Edmundsbury, as recorded on
page 80. In Normandy, at the instigation of the Archbishop of Rouen,
he had been everywhere received as an excommunicated person (cf.
Rokewode, page 127).</p>

<p><a href="#page_79">79</a>, 10. <i>Archbishopric vacant.</i>
Archbishop Baldwin died at Acre, in November, 1190; his successor
Reginald, Bishop of Bath, was elected in December, 1191, and died
after a few days. Hubert Walter, with whom Samson afterwards came into
conflict, was elected Archbishop in May, 1192 (see note on page
245).</p>

<p><a href="#page_80">80</a>, 12. <i>Archbishop of York.</i> This was
Geoffrey, the half-brother of Richard I., to whom he had sworn that he
would not return to England without the King's leave. Having returned,
he was, on his landing at Dover in September, 1191, arrested by
Longchamp's orders, and thrown into prison.</p>

<p><a href="#page_80">80</a>, 24. <i>King Henry had taken the
Cross.</i> At the interview of Henry II. with Philip of France,
between Trie and Gisors, the two Kings took the cross upon the Feast
of St Agnes, 21 January, 1188.</p>

<p><a href="#page_82">82</a>, 8. <i>War throughout England.</i> After
John's return from France in 1193, the country was in a state of
general warfare; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_241"
id="page_241">{241}</a></span> and Windsor was besieged by the Regency
with the King's other castles.</p>

<p><a href="#page_82">82</a>, 16. <i>His own standard.</i> See note to
p. 85, l. 25, below.</p>

<p><a href="#page_83">83</a>, 1. <i>Licence for holding
tournaments.</i> This was little more than a device for raising money.
In 1194 Richard ordered tournaments to be held, in order to practise
the knights in warfare. No one could joust at a tournament without a
licence; and the price of the licence varied with the rank of the
holder.</p>

<p><a href="#page_85">85</a>, 12. <i>Withgar.</i> This great thane,
who is styled in the Cartulary of Abbot John of Northwold "the famous
Earl," had the custody for Queen Emma, mother of Edward the Confessor,
of the franchise of the eight hundreds and a half which subsequently
constituted the Liberty of St. Edmund (see notes on pages 232 and
238). Mr. Rokewode says (p. 129): "The honour of Clare was composed
chiefly of the great possessions in Suffolk and Essex of Alfric, son
of Withgar or Wisgar (<i>Liber Domesday</i>)."</p>

<p><a href="#page_85">85</a>, 25. <i>Standard of St. Edmund.</i> In
the famous Harleian MS. 2278, the original book containing the
metrical life of St. Edmund by John Lydgate, presented to Henry VI. by
Bury Abbey after his visit to the monastery in 1433, there is a
pictorial representation of this Standard. It depicts Adam and Eve on
either side of the Tree of Knowledge, and the devil with a human face
and a serpent's body curled round the tree. Above the tree is a lamb
and a cross, with crescents in the background. The counterseal of
Abbot Samson also has the lamb and cross (see page 229).</p>

<p><a href="#page_86">86</a>, 6. <i>Earl Roger Bigot.</i> This Earl
was son of Hugh, the rebellious baron. It appears from the text that
the Standard of St. Edmund was carried by him into the fight at the
battle of Fornham, in October, 1173 (see p. 1).</p>

<p><a href="#page_86">86</a>, 18. <i>Robert of Cockfield.</i>
References to members of this family of Cockfield, or Cokefield,
appear often in the <i>Chronicle</i>. The dispute as to rights which
arose on Robert's death is told again in greater detail at the end of
the <i>Chronicle</i>, by William of Diss (see pp. 254-6), and the
dispute as to the wardship of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_242"
id="page_242">{242}</a></span> the daughter of Adam, son of Robert, on
pages 187-8. Nothing here arises except Samson's denial of Adam's
right of hereditary tenure, in which he was successful.</p>

<p><a href="#page_87">87</a>, 16. <i>Eight and a half hundreds.</i>
See notes to p. 44, l. 14, and p. 77, l. 23, on the Liberty of St.
Edmund (pp. 232, 238).</p>

<p><a href="#page_88">88</a>, 16. <i>Haberdon.</i> This is a field
(still called by the same name) in the south-east corner of the town,
with remains of earthworks. It was held in monastic times of the
sacrist by the singular tenure, that the tenant should find a white
bull as often as a gentlewoman should visit the shrine of St. Edmund
"to make the oblation of the said white bull," with a view to secure a
favourable answer to her prayers for offspring. On these occasions the
bull was led from his pasture on the Haberdon through the principal
streets of the town in procession to the Church of St. Edmund.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p><a href="#page_101">101</a>-105. The whole of this Chapter is
obviously an interpolation in the Chronicle by some monk other than
Jocelin himself. The story of Henry of Essex is included in the long
and elaborate "vita et passio cum miraculis Sancti Edmundi" prepared
in the fourteenth century in the monastery at Bury, and now preserved
in the Bodleian Library (MS. 240); and at the end of this transcript
the compiler adds, "Cuius narracionem Jocelinus audiens, in scriptis
redegit" (<i>Nova Legenda Anglie</i>, ed. Horstman, 1901, II. 637). It
is apparent from the opening phrase of the text (p. 105) that Jocelin,
who most probably went to Reading in the train of the Abbot, commenced
to set down the story at the bidding of Samson, but left its
completion to some other monk of inferior degree. Perhaps this was
William of Diss, who added at the end of the Chronicle (see pages
254-6) a declaration as to the lands of Robert of Cockfield.</p>

<p><a href="#page_101">101</a>, 10. <i>precept of Seneca.</i> Mr.
Arnold says: "Many things resembling this sentiment occur in the 109th
Epistle of Seneca; but probably the passage is somewhere else in his
works."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_243" id="page_243">{243}</a></span> <a
href="#page_103">103</a>, 18. <i>thrown down the standard.</i> Henry
of Essex's act of cowardice took place in 1157, during an expedition
into Flintshire, when the Welsh made a sudden attack. His dropping the
standard brought King Henry II. and the Royal army into great peril

seems to be an attempt at punning, at this point, by the monk who
wrote the original story in Latin: "Rogerus comes Clarensis, clarus

occurrisset."</p>

(Ralph de Diceto, <i>Ymag. Hist</i>. i. 310, Rolls ed.), on an eyot in
the Thames, and is still traditionally remembered at Reading.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<p><a href="#page_106">106</a>, 6. <i>stay at Melford.</i> The manor
of Melford was given to the monastery in the time of Leofstan (second
Abbot) by Earl Alfric, the son of Withgar (Parker's <i>History of Long
Melford</i>, p. 1). At Long Melford, 13 miles south of Bury, was a
country house belonging to the Abbots of Bury; and at the present
Melford Hall there are said to be still some relics of this occupancy.
After Samson died, in 1211, there was a dispute that lasted a
considerable time as to the validity of the election of Hugo, his
successor; and the Papal Legate, Nicholas, Bishop of Tusculum, who
tried vainly to compose it, stayed for some time at Melford (Arnold,
ii. 46). Abbot Simon of Luton died at his manor of Melford in April,
1279.</p>

text of this Charter of 1194, granted by Samson to the Burgesses, will
be found in Battely (<i>App.</i> xxii. 155-6) and in the
<i>Monasticon</i>, iii. 153. It confirms to the town all the customs
and liberties which it had in the times of Henry II. and his
predecessors; and it declares that with regard to watch and ward and
the custody of the gates, the ancient custom is that the town shall
furnish eight watchmen night by night, all the year round, two for
each ward, and a larger number at Christmas and on St. Edmund's Day
[20 November]; also that the town should find four gatekeepers for the
four gates, the fifth or eastern gate being in the custody of the
Abbot. Nothing is said in the Charter about the appointment of the
portreeves; but the right of burgesses to sue and be sued in their own
borough-court (portmanne-mot), instead of going outside the borough to
the hundred-mot or the shire-mot, is insisted upon. "What is evidently
assumed is that the portreeve is the Abbot's servant, and administers
justice in the Abbot's name" (Arnold, II. xxxix.).</p>

<p><a href="#page_121">121</a>, 12. <i>Abbot Robert.</i> This was
Robert II. (fourth Abbot), a monk of Westminster, elected by the
convent in 1102, but not confirmed by Henry I. until 1107. He died
shortly afterwards, on the 16th September, 1107, and, after an
interregnum <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_245"
id="page_245">{245}</a></span> of seven years, Albold, Prior of St.
Nicasius, at Meaux, succeeded him in the abbacy. Robert was buried in
the Infirmary Chapel (Douai MS.). For his character and labours, see
MS. quoted in Arnold, i. 356.</p>

<p><a href="#page_121">121</a>, 20. <i>Hubert Walter.</i> Hubert's
father, Harvey Walter, was descended from Hubert, the first Norman
settler, who received at the Conquest grants of land in Norfolk and
Suffolk. Hubert is said to have been born at West Dereham, in Norfolk
(Tanner, <i>Not. Monast. Norfolk</i>, xxi.), where lived, as will be
seen from the text (p. 121, l. 25), his mother Matilda de Valognes
(whose sister Bertha married Ranulf de Glanville). He was brought up
in Glanville's household, and was so much in his confidence that he
was afterwards said to have "shared with him in the government of
England." In 1186 he became Dean of York, and in 1189 Bishop of
Salisbury. In 1190 he went to the Holy Land, returning in 1193, in
which year he was elected Archbishop of Canterbury and appointed
justiciary. Richard's departure over sea in 1194 left him virtual
ruler of England for the next few years. He died in 1205; and in
March, 1890, a tomb opened in Canterbury Cathedral was found to
contain his remains.</p>

<p><a href="#page_124">124</a>, 6. <i>The Pope wrote.</i> This letter
of Innocent III. was dated 1st December, 1198, and was addressed (not
to the Archbishop but) to the Abbot and convent of St. Edmund
(<i>Migne's Patrologia</i>, vol. ccxiv., No. 457 of the Regesta).</p>

anniversary of Abbot Robert was "xvi Kal. Octobris" (16th September).
The anniversaries of Ording and Hugh, mentioned in line 20, were 31st
January and the 16th November.</p>

<p><a href="#page_139">139</a>, 20. <i>Chapel of St. Denis.</i> This
chapel was at the west end of the church, probably north of the great
western tower, with a chapel dedicated to St. Faith above it. Abbot
Baldwin, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_246"

was a monk of St. Denis; hence, no doubt, the dedication of a chapel
to that saint.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<p><a href="#page_142">142</a>, 5. <i>Church of Coventry.</i> Hugh de
Nonant (d. 1198), Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, had a violent
dislike to all monks, and, whenever he could, put secular canons in
their place. He had turned out the monks at Coventry, and Pope
Celestine III. appointed in 1197 a Commission, on which Samson sat,
for restoring these expelled monks. The monks were re-inducted by
Archbishop Hubert Walter on 18th January, 1198.</p>

<p><a href="#page_144">144</a>, 1. <i>Church of Wetherden.</i> This

to "the master of the school at St. Edmund," was granted in 1198 by
John, Bishop of Norwich, at the request of Samson (<i>Curtey's

<p><a href="#page_145">145</a>, 24. <i>Chapel of St. Andrew.</i>
According to the <i>Gesta Sacristarum</i> (Arnold, ii. 291) the Chapel
of St. Andrew was for the most part built and finished by the sacrist
Hugo under Samson, and seems to have been then connected with the
infirmary (iii. 87). Later on it was removed into the cemetery of the
monks (iii. 187).</p>

<p><a href="#page_145">145</a>, 25. <i>Chapels of St. Katherine and

is given by Rokewode on pp. 140-8 of his book. His daughter's name was
Nesta, and, as stated at p. 187, l. 24, she became, on her father's
death in 1198, the ward and wife of Thomas de <span class="pagenum"><a

<p><a href="#page_152">152</a>, 5. <i>Ording who lies there.</i>
Ording (d. 1156) was one of six abbots who were buried in the Chapter
House, and whose names are recorded in the MS., circa 1425, discovered
by Dr. Montagu James at Douai (<i>James</i>, p. 180). The original
chapter house of the monastery was built by Godefridus, the sacrist,
about 1107. There was a fire which destroyed all the convent
buildings, and Helyas, the sacrist, Ording's nephew, "reformavit ad
plenum" the chapter house. His uncle was the first Abbot buried there.
Ording's place of sepulture was nearest to the east end or dais. Hugo
and Samson, Ording's successors, were also buried in Helyas's chapter
house: Samson being, according to the Douai MS. "sepultus in capitulo
sedus ad pedes Ric. Abb. sub lapidibus marmoreis ut suprascriptum est
de Abb. Ordingo." About 1220 Richard of Newport, then sacrist, "vetus
capitulum destruxit, et novum a fundamentis construxit." (Arnold, II.
293.) Afterwards Richard of Insula (1229-34), Henry of Rushbrook
(1234-46), and Edmund of Walpole (1248-56) were also buried in the
chapter house. Its dimensions, according to William of Worcester's
measurements in 1479, were 60 paces by 20. In the course of some
recent excavations (1902-3) the coffins of five of the above Abbots,
and much worked stone and marble, have been found on the site of this
chapter house.</p>

<p><a href="#page_152">152</a>, 19. <i>tenant of the cellarer, by name
Ketel</i>. As Ketel dwelt "without the gate," he was, being "of the
cellarer's fee," subject to the "judicial duel" which William I. had
introduced; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_248"
id="page_248">{248}</a></span> whereas the argument of his
fellow-burgesses seems to have been that if he had dwelt within the
borough he would have been tried and acquitted or condemned by the
"oaths of his neighbours"&mdash;the compurgators out of whom our jury
system grew. The monks recognized that the time had come when the
franchise of the town should be extended to the rural possessions of
the Abbey, and all brought under a common jurisdiction.</p>

<p><a href="#page_153">153</a>, 6. <i>within the jurisdiction.</i>
"Infra bannamleucam," defined by Ducange as a certain territory by the
boundaries of which the jurisdiction and immunities of any place,
whether a town or monastery, were limited. <i>Bannum</i> is here used
in the sense of jurisdiction; and the amount of territory so
enfranchised was usually reckoned as a league either way, hence banna
leuca or banlieue. The exempt jurisdiction of Bury Abbey was limited
to the circuit of a mile within four crosses.</p>

<p><a href="#page_153">153</a>, 6. <i>Villeins of Hardwick.</i> The
Latin word is <i>lancettos</i>, serfs holding by base services. In one
of the cartularies of St. Edmund, the "Lancetti de Hardwick" were to
cleanse the latrines of the monastery.</p>

<p><a href="#page_154">154</a>, 23. <i>Beodricsworth.</i> This is the
ancient name of Bury St. Edmunds. Mr. Arnold says (I. iv.) the name of
Beodric "seems to mean 'a table chieftain,' <i>comp.</i> beod. geneat,
a table companion. But there is some countenance in the MSS. for
Beadricsworth, which would come from beadu-rica, one mighty in war."
Seynt Edmunds Biri is first substituted for Beodricsworth in Charters
from Edward the Confessor to the Monastery (cf. page 260 and Battely,
<i>App.</i> ix. 134).</p>

<p><a href="#page_155">155</a>, 14. <i>Aver-peni.</i> The money paid

work for his lord by horse or ox, or by carriage with either.</p>

<p><a href="#page_155">155</a>, 20. <i>Eels from Southrey.</i> Ælgiva,
Queen of Canute, gave to the Monastery yearly four thousand eels, with
her gifts which pertained thereto at Lakenheath. The manor of
Southrey, in Norfolk, with three fisheries, was appropriated to the
cellarer (Rokewode, p. 151).</p>

<p><a href="#page_164">164</a>, 11. <i>Chest with the shirt of St.
Edmund.</i> Archdeacon Herman, in his treatise <i>De Miraculis Sancto
Eadmundi</i> (Arnold, i. 26 <i>et seq.</i>), describes how Leofstan
(2nd Abbot) decided to open the coffin containing St. Edmund's body
and examine the remains. The body was found covered with a vestment
stained with blood and pierced with arrows. This was taken off and the
body wrapped in a linen sheet. In the continuation of Herman's work,
ascribed to Samson himself, there is an account of another Herman, a
monk of Bury, and a popular preacher, who displayed irreverently
certain relics of St. Edmund. He took the shirt out of its casket, and
unfolded it for the people to kiss. Tolinus the sacrist commented
severely on the occurrence, and on the third day at sunset Herman
died. The "feretrum cum camisia S. Edmundi" was amongst the relics
carried in procession round the Church on Christmas Day, Palm Sunday,
Easter Day, and probably other high festivals (Rituale, Harl. MS. 297,
cent, xiv., quoted by <i>James</i>, p. 183).</p>

<p><a href="#page_165">165</a>, 1. <i>Cup of St. Edmund.</i> To
drinking from this cup various miracles are ascribed: a rich lady
cured after long suffering from fever; a Dunwich man with dropsy; a
girl afflicted with a great swelling, who drinks from the cup thrice
in the name of the Trinity; a Cluniac monk of St. Saviour's,
Southwark, named Gervasius, whose story is told in great detail in
Samson's <i>De Miraculis</i> (Arnold, i. 202-3). It is said that an
indulgence <i>toties quoties</i> was granted to pilgrims who drank
from this cup "in the worshippe of God and Saint Edmund," hence its
name of "Pardon Bowl"; but I have not found the original authority for
this.</p>

<p><a href="#page_171">171</a>, 18. <i>verse inscribed.</i> In the
<i>Cronica Burienis</i> (Arnold, iii. 8) this verse is given in a
slightly different form&mdash;"Martyris ecce zoma Michaelis servet agalma,"
the writer adding, "Agalma, id est, sacra receptacula divinitatis."
"Zoma" is probably the Greek word "soma," body. But it has also been
translated "garment," and Carlyle's version of the inscription
(<i>Past and Present</i>, ch. xvi.) is, "This is the Martyr's garment,
which Michael's Image guards." Lord Francis Hervey, in his edition
(1902) of Recce's <i>Breviary of Suffolk</i>, says, "Having regard to
the fondness of the mediæval versifiers for rhyme, I feel tempted to
suggest that the word may have been 'salma,' a word of unknown origin,
which in Italian means corpse.... The verse in question was most
probably not home made, and was not clearly intelligible to the monks
themselves."</p>

<p><a href="#page_171">171</a>, 21. <i>iron rings.</i> This phrase is
somewhat obscure: "annuli ferrei sicut solebat fieri in cista
Norensi." Ducange gives "Norrensis" as an occasional equivalent for
Northmannus, hence Mr. Arnold suggests for cista Norensis "a Norwegian
chest" (i. 311).</p>

<p><a href="#page_175">175</a>, 10. <i>Ailwin the monk.</i> Ailwin,
also written Egelwin, was keeper of the shrine of St. Edmund before
the foundation of the Abbey. In view of the invasion of England by the
Danish chief Turchil, Ailwin fled, in 1010, from Beodricsworth to
London with the body of St. Edmund, returning 1014. In 1050 Ailwin,
then a very aged man, was invited by Abbot Leofstan to come from Hulme
to Bury to identify the body of the Saint.</p>

<p><a href="#page_176">176</a>, 18. <i>Keeper of St. Botolph.</i>
There was a chapel (probably on the south side of the presbytery)
dedicated to St. Botolph, in which was the shrine with the relics of
that Saint.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<p><a href="#page_178">178</a>, 6. <i>King John ... came down to St.
Edmund.</i> John paid several visits to Bury Abbey during Samson's
abbacy: once in 1199, immediately after his coronation, when he made
the miserable offering described by Jocelin on p. 178; a second time
in 1201, when returning from Northumberland; a third time in 1203,
when, according to Rokewode (p. 154), "he made a pilgrimage to St.
Edmund's, at the feast of St. Thomas the Apostle, and gave the convent
ten marcs annually, payable from the exchequer, for the repairs of the
shrine of St. Edmund, in consideration of the monks giving back to the
King, for his life, a sapphire and ruby, which he had offered to the
Saint, and which were to revert to the convent." In connection with
the disputed question of the nomination of Samson's successor (which
lasted for over two years), John came to Bury on November 4, 1114, and
meeting the monks in the chapter house, made them a speech as to his
own rights in the matter, which is recorded in Arnold, II. xv. and
95-6.</p>

was another claimant for the wardship of Nesta of Cockfield, not here
mentioned, viz., King Richard I., who (see pp. 148-9) was defied by
Samson, but was appeased by a present of some horses, dogs, and other
valuable gifts. "Here you may see what misery followeth the tenure by
Knight's service: if the tenant dieth, leaving his heir within age,
how the poor child may be tossed and tumbled, chopped and changed,
bought and sold like a jade in Smithfield, and what is more, married
to whom it pleaseth his guardian, whereof ensue many evils" (Rastell:

of Cluny. Much information about him may be found in Dr. J. B. Hurry's
admirable <i>History of Reading Abbey</i>, 1901, whence the following
note as to precedence is taken: "Sir Henry Englefield
(<i>Archaeologia</i>, vol. vi. p. 61) states that the Abbot of Reading
took precedence after the Abbots of Glastonbury and St. Albans. But it
is probable that no such definite order was observed.... In the
Articles of Faith under Convocation, 28 Henry VIII., the following is
the order of signatures&mdash;St. Albans, Westminster, St. Edmunds Bury,
Glastonbury, Reading."</p>

of Bury Abbey shortly after its compilation. Diceto has often been
identified with Diss in Norfolk: and there are evidences that William
of Diss had a good deal to do with Jocelin's Chronicle (cf. pages 242,
254). Bishop Stubbs thinks that Diceto is "an artificial name, adopted
by its bearer as the Latin name of a place with which he was
associated," and this he suggests may be one of three places in
Maine.</p>

difficulty as to jurisdiction that arose in the case of Monk's Eleigh
with Christ Church, Canterbury (see chapter vii. and notes to p. 77,
l. 23, and p. 78, l. 16) occurred with the Bishop of Ely; and it
lasted an equally long time. In the <i>Excerpta Cantabrigiensia</i>
(Arnold, III. 188) is a long account of a "Contentio inter monasterium
S. Edmundi et episcopum Eliensum" (Univ. Lib. Ff. 2, 29) respecting the
return to writs affecting places within the Liberty of St. Edmund. The
Bishop claimed that when a writ came down to the Sheriff of Suffolk
referring to a place which, though within the liberty of St. Edmund,
belonged to the see of Ely, it was the duty of the sheriff to send
that writ for execution, not to the abbot, but to the bishop; and the
abbot claimed that the ancient jurisdiction of St. Edmund would thus
be infringed. Since the liberty of St. Edmund comprised eight and a
half hundreds in the county of Suffolk, within which hundreds the see
of Ely possessed many manors, it is obvious that if the charge and
execution of writs affecting these manors were withheld from the abbot
and given to the bishop, the jurisdiction of St. Edmund would be to
that extent impaired <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_254"
id="page_254">{254}</a></span> and restricted. The Contentio begins with a
reference to the King's decision just given (1408) in favour of Bury
against the Canterbury monks (see note on page 239), and goes on to
describe the efforts made by Abbot Cratfield to stop the encroachments
of Bishop Fordham of Ely, with whom he proposes a meeting, from which
the bishop excuses himself. The controversy dragged on, with many
adjournments and delays, all of which the (Bury) writer lays to the
charge of the other side: nor was it concluded at the date (1426 or
1427) when the tract was written (Arnold, III. xviii.-xix.).</p>

<i>Liber Albus</i>, from which Jocelin's Chronicle is taken, is a
memorandum by William of Diss, which, as it has been printed both by
Rokewode and Arnold, is translated below, though it is not by Jocelin.
It is merely an expansion of the story told by Jocelin himself on pp.
86-8. Adam of Cockfield wanted to claim his father's lands by
hereditary right; but William of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_255"
id="page_255">{255}</a></span> Diss gives the evidence against this claim.
The succession was: Lenmere, Adam the first (married Adeliza), Robert
(died 1191), Adam the claimant (died 1198), who married Rohesia, and
had a daughter Nesta, over whose wardship there was the dispute
recorded on page 187.</p>

<p>"Robert of Cockfield acknowledged to my lord abbot Samson, in the
presence of many persons&mdash;Master W. of Banham, brother W. of Diss,
chaplains, William of Breiton, and many others&mdash;that he had no
hereditary right in the vills of Groton and Semere. For in the days of
King Stephen, when the peace was disturbed, the monks of St. Edmund,
with the consent of the abbot, granted the aforesaid two vills to Adam
of Cockfield, his father, to be held all the days of his life: Semere
for the annual payment of one hundred shillings, and Groton by the
payment of an annual rent, because Adam could defend the aforesaid
towns against the holders of the neighbouring castles, W. of Milden
and W. of Ambli, in that he had a castle of his own near to the
aforesaid manors, namely, the castle of Lelesey.</p>

<p>"After the death of the aforesaid Adam, they granted the said
manors to Robert of Cockfield, son of Adam, at a double rate for
Semere, that is an annual rent of ten pounds, so long as the lords
abbots and the convent wish. But he never had a charter for it, not
even to the end of his life. He had good charters for all the
tenements which he held of St. Edmund by hereditary right, which
charters I, William, known as William of Diss, at that time chaplain,
read, in the hearing of many, in the presence of the aforesaid abbot:
that is for the lands of Lelesey, which Ulfric of Lelesey held of St.
Edmund in the same township; the charter of the abbot and convent
concerning the socages of Rougham, which Mistress Rohesia of
Cockfield, once wife of Adam the younger, brought as her dowry; for
the lands also which Lenmere, his ancestor, held in the town of
Cockfield by hereditary right, and which in the time of King Stephen,
with the consent of Anselm, abbot of St. Edmund, were changed <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_256" id="page_256">{256}</a></span> into half a
knight's fee, although at first they had been socages of St.
Edmund.</p>

<p>"He had also charters of the abbot and convent of St. Edmund, for
the lands which are in the town of St. Edmund; for the land, that is
to say, of Hemfrid Criketot, where the houses of Mistress Adeliza were
once situated. They have also a hereditary charter for a great
messuage, under a payment of twelve pence, where the hall of Adam the
first, of Cockfield, was of old situate, with a wooden tower seven
times twenty feet in height. It was confirmed to them as hereditary
right by the charter of the abbot and convent, in which charter are
specified the length and breadth of that place and messuage, to be
held by a payment of two shillings. They also hold a hereditary
charter for the lands which Robert of Cockfield, son of Odo of
Cockfield, now holds in Barton. But they have no charter for the
township of Cockfield, that is, for the portion which pertains to the
food of the monks of St. Edmund.</p>

<p>"Then there was one brief of King Henry I., in which he commands
Abbot Anselm to allow Adam of Cockfield the first to hold in peace the
farm of Cockfield, and others, as long as he pays rents in full; and
that brief was sealed only of one part, representing the royal
form&mdash;against the form of all royal briefs.</p>

<p>"But Robert of Cockfield claimed, in the presence of the lord abbot
and the aforesaid, that he believed Cockfield to be his hereditary
right on account of his long tenure: because his grandfather, Lenmere,
held that manor for a long time before his death, and Adam the first,
his son, for the term of his life, and he, Robert, all his
life&mdash;well-nigh sixty years; but they never had a charter of the abbot
or the convent of St. Edmund for the aforesaid land."</p>

<p class="nodent">[<i>Editor's Note.</i>&mdash;I had originally
contemplated printing only the dates included in Section II. of this
Table, but at the suggestion of the general Editor of the series, I
have extended it backwards and forwards so as to give a rapid
<i>aperçu</i> of the history of Bury Abbey from its earliest
beginnings up to the present date. The Table may have a use other than
for readers of <i>Jocelin's Chronicle</i>, as it brings to a focus a
mass of chronological information now scattered over a great variety
of books.</p>

<p>For unfortunately there does not exist at present any adequate
history of Bury Abbey, one of the most ancient, flourishing and
important of the Benedictine institutions in England. There are
adequate materials&mdash;at any rate for some of the periods of its
existence&mdash;in the copious manuscripts relating to Bury (many of them
formerly belonging to the monastery) now on the shelves of our public
libraries and in private hands; and it seems a pity that no one has
the courage to undertake a task which, though formidable, has been
successfully accomplished in the case of other foundations of less
fame.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
